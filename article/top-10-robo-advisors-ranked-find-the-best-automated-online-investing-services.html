Low fees, a watchful HAL 9000 eye and Spock-like objectivity are <a href="why-investors-are-flocking-to-robo-advisors-instead-of-traditional-planners.html">some of the reasons why</a>. There are so many services to choose from that we narrowed the field to the Top 10 for you. OK, technically, the Top 9 -- with the last slot serving as an inventory of additional players in the sector.</p>
<p>Remember, the fees listed in the ranking are in addition to charges imbedded in the investments, such as management expenses found in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). <a href="automated-investments-made-by-machines-better-than-man-made.html">Robo advisors</a> are listed in descending order, based on reported assets-under-management.</p>

<p>Assets under management: $4.2 billion</p>
<p>Fees: 0.30% annually, $100,000 minimum</p>
<p>The venerable index mutual fund company put a knot in the gut of financial advisors everywhere when it began a beta rollout of its <a href="online-investing-advice-niche-players-suddenly-dwarfed-by-industry-giant.html">online allocation service</a>. It quickly rose to the top of the heap, blossoming from just over $700 million in assets under management in 2013 to a staggering $4.2 billion by October of 2014. But Vanguard puts an emphasis on working with a “partner advisor,” even though investment rebalancing is built-in to the online tool. And of course, you’ll be using Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs, <a href="build-etf-portfolio-1000.html" target="_blank">though that’s not necessarily a bad thing</a>.<br > <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-robo-advisors-ranked-find-the-best-automated-online-investing-services' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Asset Builder is the online portfolio platform that uses funds from Texas-based Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), a mutual fund family offered through financial advisors. Services include: annual account rebalancing with eight model portfolios to choose from. However, there are commissions charged on trades – from $20 to $49.95, depending on your account balance. Buying a dozen mutual funds to launch your portfolio will cost you $240 to $600, right off the bat.

<p>SigFig started out as a free “account aggregation” tool, allowing users to compile their financial accounts into one view. As usual, the service uses ETFs in its portfolios, though the lineup varies depending on where your account is held (SigFig currently works with TD Ameritrade, Fidelity or Schwab). Users can also opt to have just a portion of their assets managed and handle the rest on their own.

<p><strong>All the rest</strong></p>
<p>This is a vibrant and rapidly expanding segment of the <a href="most-financial-planners-are-not-real-financial-planners-at-all.html">financial advice industry</a> with many current players – and some established Wall Street names rapidly moving into the space, just as Vanguard did.</p>
<p>Schwab is poised to rollout a “no-fee” robo service, which will certainly change the landscape. The firm’s “Intelligent Portfolios” will require only a $5,000 opening balance with 24/7 support from licensed reps. A call to Schwab revealed that the service is set to debut by the end of March, possibly even sooner. Meanwhile, Fidelity is partnering with Betterment to offer its own <a href="robo-advisors-gaining-influence-assets.html">automated investment platform</a>.</p>

<p>And there’s even a no-help, no-allocation, do-it-yourself $0 commission platform for trading stocks that is currently in beta, called Robinhood. Big VC money is backing it too, making the financial services business – with or without advice – an increasingly commoditized offering.</p>
