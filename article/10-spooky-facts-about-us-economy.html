<p>NEW YORK (<a target="_self" href="../index.html">MainStreet</a>) -- Forget werewolves, zombies and evil spirits. As Halloween nears, nothing could be scarier than the current state of our economy. <br /><br />Although the country has been out of <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/3-better-ways-measure-recession">recession </a>for more than two years, <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/career/employment/what-recovery-household-incomes-plummeted-after-2009">recent statistics</a> are still enough to send chills down the spine – from an unemployment rate higher than 9% to increased poverty numbers and a soaring national debt. <br /><br />To make matters worse, many experts say we should brace ourselves for more tough times in 2012.<br /><br />“In the fourth quarter of this year people will probably ramp up spending for the holidays, but when the bills come in and people realize the financial reality of their situation, they’ll probably cut back dramatically in the first three months [of 2012],” says Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at The Economic Outlook Group. “That could trigger a downturn in the economy.”<br /><br />Baumohl predicts at least a one-quarter contraction in 2012, and says we might even be “on the edge” of another recession, or two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. <br /><br />Read on to discover 10 of the most frightening facts about where we stand right now – and prepare to be spooked.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Lack of Jobs</strong></p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ September <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">jobs report</a> offered little encouragement for those hoping for significant economic progress. <br /><br />“There are some disturbing trends that would suggest that the labor markets are not only weak, but that they are likely to continue to be weak,” says Baumohl. <br /><br />Unemployment rang in at 9.1% – about what it’s been since April – and those with less education were hit particularly hard. The unemployment rate in September for adults 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher was 4.2%, versus 8.4% for those with some college or an associate’s degree, 9.7% for high school graduates with no college and 14% for those with less than a high school diploma. <br /><br />“This is the population that really suffers the most when there’s an economic downturn,” says Baumohl. “At a time when employers really have their choice, they’re certainly going to go with the more educated workforce.” <br /><br />Also disturbing, says Dirk Krueger, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, is the rising number of long-term <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/smart-spending/what-do-when-you-run-out-unemployment">unemployed workers</a>. According to the report, the number of those jobless for 27 weeks and more was approximately 6.2 million in September 2011 (44.6% of the unemployed population), versus 6.1 million (41.8% of the unemployed population) the same month in 2010. <br /><br />Baumohl also says that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economicoutlookgroup.com/research-reports/2011/October-14.pdf">private-sector hiring</a> has been on a steady decline during each quarter thus far in 2011. “In the first quarter you have an average monthly rate of 191,000 private new jobs being created, in the second quarter that number drops to 138,000 and in third quarter it’s 117,000,” says Baumohl. “This is certainly not a sign that employers are ready to ramp up hiring at this point.” <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>High Gas Prices</strong></p>
<p>Americans have been feeling pain at the pump for the past few years, with gas prices jumping from an average retail price of $1.61 per gallon at the end of 2008 to $3.00 at the end of 2010, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economicoutlookgroup.com/forecasts.php">Economic Outlook Group</a>. <br /><br />As of Monday, the average price of regular gas in the U.S. was $3.48 per gallon, according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://205.254.135.24/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_home_page.html">Energy Information Administration</a>. <br /><br />And it doesn’t look as though there’s any relief in sight: The Economic Outlook Group <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economicoutlookgroup.com/forecasts.php">forecasts </a>that prices will hit $3.70 per gallon by the end of 2012. Baumohl adds that “gas prices will likely fluctuate between $3 and $5 a gallon in the next three years. The point is that cheap gas is a thing of the past.”<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><br /><strong>Declining Household Incomes </strong><br /><br />It’s hardly surprising that incomes for American families dropped during the recession. According to data collected by two former Census Bureau officials in a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sentierresearch.com/pressreleases/SentierResearch_PressRelease_October_10_2011.pdf">report for Sentier Research</a>, median annual income for U.S. households before taxes <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/career/employment/what-recovery-household-incomes-plummeted-after-2009">dropped </a>from $55,309 when the recession officially began in December 2007 to $53,518 in June 2009 – a 3.2% decline. <br /><br />But what may come as a shock is that in the two years after the recession officially ended in June 2009, median household income continued to plunge, decreasing by more than $3,500 to $49,909 in June 2011. That’s a decline of 6.7% in the first two years of the recovery, which is more than twice the rate of decline experienced during the Great Recession.<br /><br />According to the report, groups hit particularly hard include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family households with a male or female head and no spouse present (many with children in the household), which declined by 7.3%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Households with a head under 25 years old, which declined by 9.5%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Households with a head looking for work or on layoff (unemployed), which declined by 18.4%</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Households with a Black (not Hispanic) head, which declined by 9.4%</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Continuing Housing Crisis </strong></p>
<p>The ailing housing industry has taken quite a beating during the past few years, and despite some recent signs of improvement, full recovery still seems a long way off.<br /><br />On a positive note, according to the Standard &amp; Poor’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldocumentfile&amp;blobtable=SPComSecureDocument&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3Ddownload.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1245321043141&amp;blobheadervalue3=abinary%3B+charset%3DUTF-8&amp;blobnocache=true">Case-Shiller Home Price Index</a>, the housing market showed four straight months of home-value growth through July 2011. And on Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced a 15% upswing in housing starts – or the number of new residential construction projects – in September. But despite these pieces of good news, the rate of homeownership in the U.S. decreased by 1.1 percentage points, to 65.1%, between 2000 and 2010, according to the latest Census Bureau data. The decrease is the largest posted since the decade between <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/buying/homeownership-has-biggest-drop-70-years">1930 and 1940</a>. <br /><br />FICO’s latest <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/housing-recovery-may-not-come-until-2020">quarterly survey</a> of bank risk managers, released on Sept. 30, estimated that a U.S. housing recovery wouldn’t happen before 2020. Specifically, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fico.com/en/Company/News/Pages/09-30-2011.aspx">FICO survey</a> asked bank risk managers if U.S. housing prices would return to 2007 levels before 2020; 49% of the bank managers said no, while 21% answered yes. <br /><br />What’s more, a new <a target="_blank" href="http://tippie.uiowa.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=2662">University of Iowa study</a> shows that younger Americans are increasingly <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/selling/young-people-shut-out-home-ownership">shut out of homeownership</a>. The study says that Americans between the ages of 25 and 44 have suffered disproportionately in the economic downturn, and only 57% of that demographic owned their own home in 2007. That’s down from 61% in 1980. <br /><br />“With banks demanding a far greater down payment than most young people can afford, it keeps home ownership out of reach for many,” says Baumohl. “Since an investment in one’s home historically represented an important source of wealth for Americans over the long term, being deprived of homeownership will slow the accumulation of wealth for this demographic group.”<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Mortgage Fraud &amp; Default Up </strong></p>
<p>Declining home values have caused many homeowners to stop making payments on their mortgages, despite having the financial capacity to do so. The process is called <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/foreclosure/zombie-debt-makes-strategic-default-less-strategic">strategic default</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fico.com/en/Company/News/Pages/10-10-2011.aspx">FICO </a>estimates that it’s a $20 billion problem for mortgage lenders that will likely get worse before it gets better. <br /><br />As MainStreet has reported, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realtor.com/blogs/2011/10/14/fico-helps-top-mortgage-servicers-combat-strategic-defaults/">study </a>from the University of Chicago School of Business said that 35% of mortgage defaults in September 2010 were <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/lenders-fight-back-against-strategic-defaulters">strategic defaults</a>. In March 2009, that number was just 26%. <br /><br />“Too many homeowners are walking away or not paying their mortgage just because the value went down and they are under water, yet that was their contractual obligation,” says certified financial planner Laura Scharr-Bykowsky of Ascend Financial Planning. “If everyone just decided to walk away just because they were under water, the downward spiral would continue. This is a huge risk to the system.” <br /><br />What’s also worrisome is the uptick in <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/report-mortgage-fraud-88">mortgage fraud</a> cases. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s Mortgage Loan Fraud Update, there was an 88% increase in U.S. mortgage fraud cases in the second quarter of 2011 from the same period a year ago. The types of fraud that turned up the most included debt-elimination scams, false mortgage applications and identity theft – revealing the drastic measures people will take in these trying economic times to purchase or keep a home.  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>More Student Loan Defaults </strong></p>
<p>Students have been hit particularly hard by the ailing economy, as the grim job market prevented many from earning enough money to stay on top of their student loans. In a September report, the Department of Education reported that <a target="_self" href="http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/default-rates-rise-federal-student-loans">default rates</a> for federal student loans had risen in recent years – from 7% in fiscal year 2008 to 8.8% for borrowers whose first loan repayments came due between Oct. 1, 2008, and Sept. 30, 2009, and who defaulted before Sept. 30, 2010.  <br /><br />Baumohl says that the effect of defaulting can haunt students for years to come. “It’s going to be a big black asterisk on their credit history, which is a terrible thing since they’re just starting out,” he says. <br /><br />Baumohl adds that it’s no surprise the <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/5-things-occupy-wall-street-protesters-should-demand">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement consists of so many young people. “It’s just a reflection of the anger, frustration and exasperation that so many students and graduates are having,” he says. <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

According to the report, since 2007, the number of men working full time year-round with earnings decreased by 6.6 million and the number of corresponding women declined by 2.8 million.<br /><br />Also unsettling is that the report says that young adults aged 25-34 who are living with their parents had an official poverty rate of 8.4%, but if their poverty status were determined using their own income, 45.3% had an income below the poverty threshold for a single person under 65.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/Americans-Access-Basic-Necessities-Recession-Level.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Credit%20Crisis%20-%20Housing">Gallup</a>’s monthly survey of more than 29,000 adults, the percentage of Americans with health insurance coverage declined 3.6 points in the past three years – from 85.9% in September 2008 to 82.3% in September 2011.  <br /><br />The survey also found that in September 2011, some 78.3% of those surveyed had a personal doctor and only 64% had visited a dentist in the previous year, down by 4.2 percentage points and 2.6 percentage points since September 2008, respectively. This is likely due to scarce funds for many households as well as the decrease in the percentage of Americans with health insurance.<br /><br />“While the recession officially ended more than two years ago, the effects on Americans continue to linger,” the study says.  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Historic National Debt</strong></p>
<p>After being hotly debated by both houses, Congress voted to raise the debt ceiling to a historic high this summer, and today the national debt stands at a staggering <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">$14.9 trillion</a>. The decision has led many to wonder how the government will reduce this overwhelming debt in the years to come, such as through higher taxes and cuts on government programs.<br /><br />As part of the debt-ceiling agreement, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for reducing the deficit by a total of $2.1 trillion over the next decade, about $900 billion of which was approved at the time. The <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/meet-debt-super-committee">deal </a>created a 12-member bipartisan committee to come up with a plan to reduce the remainder of that sum by Nov. 23, and called for a series of automatic reductions to take effect if the committee fails to come to an agreement. <br /><br />As MainStreet reported last month, if the <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/what-happens-if-debt-supercommittee-fails">committee </a>does fail, the automatic reductions would call for across-the-board cuts for discretionary and non-discretionary spending, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that defense program cuts would range from 10% in 2013 to 8.5% in 2021, saving some $450 billion; cuts to new spending for non-defense programs would range from 7.8% in 2013 to 5.5% in 2021, saving nearly $300 billion; and Medicare spending would be cut 2% each year, saving $170 billion.</p>
<p>“Everyone is concerned about the historic buildup in public debt, but the bigger worry for me is if Washington rushes to make draconian cuts in government spending now when the economy seems so starved of domestic demand – and so close to slipping into recession,” Baumohl says. <br /><br />Whatever decisions are made, cuts must come from somewhere, and the American public is likely to feel the pinch.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

The unemployment rate in September for adults 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher was 4.2%, versus 8.4% for those with some college or an associate’s degree, 9.7% for high school graduates with no college and 14% for those with less than a high school diploma. <br /><br />“This is the population that really suffers the most when there’s an economic downturn,” says Baumohl. “At a time when employers really have their choice, they’re certainly going to go with the more educated workforce.” <br /><br />Also disturbing, says Dirk Krueger, a professor of economics at the University of Pennsylvania, is the rising number of long-term <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/smart-spending/what-do-when-you-run-out-unemployment \">unemployed workers<\u002fa>. According to the report, the number of those jobless for 27 weeks and more was approximately 6.2 million in September 2011 (44.6% of the unemployed population), versus 6.1 million (41.8% of the unemployed population) the same month in 2010. <br /><br />Baumohl also says that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.economicoutlookgroup.com/research-reports/2011/October-14.pdf\">private-sector hiring<\u002fa> has been on a steady decline during each quarter thus far in 2011. “In the first quarter you have an average monthly rate of 191,000 private new jobs being created, in the second quarter that number drops to 138,000 and in third quarter it’s 117,000,” says Baumohl. “This is certainly not a sign that employers are ready to ramp up hiring at this point.” <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"Smartorialism: How to Make High-Fashion But Economical Moves","callout":"The compulsion for American women to refresh their wardrobe costs them dearly – to the tune of $160 million annually.

That’s a decline of 6.7% in the first two years of the recovery, which is more than twice the rate of decline experienced during the Great Recession.<br /><br />According to the report, groups hit particularly hard include the following:<\u002fp>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Family households with a male or female head and no spouse present (many with children in the household), which declined by 7.3%<\u002fli>\r\n<\u002ful>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Households with a head under 25 years old, which declined by 9.5%<\u002fli>\r\n<\u002ful>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Households with a head looking for work or on layoff (unemployed), which declined by 18.4%<\u002fli>\r\n<\u002ful>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Households with a Black (not Hispanic) head, which declined by 9.4%<\u002fli>\r\n<\u002ful>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.8860890113201311' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv><br />“The fact that median household income has dropped just tells you the enormous stress that households find themselves in at this point,” says Baumohl. “It will only lead to further caution in terms of spending, and that is obviously not something that’s going to help the economy.”<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"Are Drones Ready for the Mass Market?

And on Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department announced a 15% upswing in housing starts – or the number of new residential construction projects – in September. But despite these pieces of good news, the rate of homeownership in the U.S. decreased by 1.1 percentage points, to 65.1%, between 2000 and 2010, according to the latest Census Bureau data. The decrease is the largest posted since the decade between <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/buying/homeownership-has-biggest-drop-70-years\">1930 and 1940<\u002fa>. <br /><br />FICO’s latest <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/housing-recovery-may-not-come-until-2020\">quarterly survey<\u002fa> of bank risk managers, released on Sept. 30, estimated that a U.S. housing recovery wouldn’t happen before 2020. Specifically, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fico.com/en/Company/News/Pages/09-30-2011.aspx \">FICO survey<\u002fa> asked bank risk managers if U.S. housing prices would return to 2007 levels before 2020; 49% of the bank managers said no, while 21% answered yes. <br /><br />What’s more, a new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://tippie.uiowa.edu/news/story.cfm?ID=2662 \">University of Iowa study<\u002fa> shows that younger Americans are increasingly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/selling/young-people-shut-out-home-ownership \">shut out of homeownership<\u002fa>. The study says that Americans between the ages of 25 and 44 have suffered disproportionately in the economic downturn, and only 57% of that demographic owned their own home in 2007. That’s down from 61% in 1980. <br /><br />“With banks demanding a far greater down payment than most young people can afford, it keeps home ownership out of reach for many,” says Baumohl. “Since an investment in one’s home historically represented an important source of wealth for Americans over the long term, being deprived of homeownership will slow the accumulation of wealth for this demographic group.”<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"Killing Your Credit Rating Is a Lot Easier Than Building It Up","callout":"It only takes three months to destroy a credit rating.","authorName":"Nicholas Pell","authorId":1610611,"url":"/article/killing-your-credit-rating-is-a-lot-easier-than-building-it-up","storyId":13062354,"publishDate":"2015-03-03T11:15:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Mar 3, 2015 6:15 AM EST","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/creditscore_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/creditscore.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-70668bbe-18c7-4032-bddf-11577b35ce7d\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"7 Travel Rewards Cards To Deliver You From This Frozen Hellscape","callout":"With snow still piled up and the cold not yet waning, now might be a good time to earn some points and ditch foreign credit card transaction fees.","authorName":"Jason Notte","authorId":1145802,"url":"/article/7-travel-rewards-cards-to-deliver-you-from-this-frozen-hellscape","storyId":13050981,"publishDate":"2015-02-24T12:00:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Feb 24, 2015 7:00 AM EST","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/chasesapphirepreferred_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/chasesapphirepreferred.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card"},{"headline":"The Year of the Smart Credit Card -

In March 2009, that number was just 26%. <br /><br />“Too many homeowners are walking away or not paying their mortgage just because the value went down and they are under water, yet that was their contractual obligation,” says certified financial planner Laura Scharr-Bykowsky of Ascend Financial Planning. “If everyone just decided to walk away just because they were under water, the downward spiral would continue. This is a huge risk to the system.” <br /><br />What’s also worrisome is the uptick in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/real-estate/report-mortgage-fraud-88\">mortgage fraud<\u002fa> cases. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s Mortgage Loan Fraud Update, there was an 88% increase in U.S. mortgage fraud cases in the second quarter of 2011 from the same period a year ago.

The decision has led many to wonder how the government will reduce this overwhelming debt in the years to come, such as through higher taxes and cuts on government programs.<br /><br />As part of the debt-ceiling agreement, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011, which called for reducing the deficit by a total of $2.1 trillion over the next decade, about $900 billion of which was approved at the time. The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/meet-debt-super-committee\">deal <\u002fa>created a 12-member bipartisan committee to come up with a plan to reduce the remainder of that sum by Nov. 23, and called for a series of automatic reductions to take effect if the committee fails to come to an agreement. <br /><br />As MainStreet reported last month, if the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/what-happens-if-debt-supercommittee-fails\">committee <\u002fa>does fail, the automatic reductions would call for across-the-board cuts for discretionary and non-discretionary spending, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating that defense program cuts would range from 10% in 2013 to 8.5% in 2021, saving some $450 billion; cuts to new spending for non-defense programs would range from 7.8% in 2013 to 5.5% in 2021, saving nearly $300 billion; and Medicare spending would be cut 2% each year, saving $170 billion.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>“Everyone is concerned about the historic buildup in public debt, but the bigger worry for me is if Washington rushes to make draconian cuts in government spending now when the economy seems so starved of domestic demand – and so close to slipping into recession,” Baumohl says. <br /><br />Whatever decisions are made, cuts must come from somewhere, and the American public is likely to feel the pinch.<\u002fp><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-spooky-facts-about-us-economy' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"Buy a New Carry-on Bag or Pay the Price","callout":"Airlines are narrowing their carry-on bag requirements, and if you haven't updated your luggage, you may find yourself out significant cash.","authorName":"Naomi Mannino","authorId":1610705,"url":"/article/buy-new-carry-bag-or-pay-price","storyId":12786366,"publishDate":"2014-07-02T13:50:52Z","publishDateAsString":"Jul 2, 2014 9:50 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/carryonluggage-120x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/carryonluggage-front-lead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-20f3cdf6-c863-4996-bfe7-722bfefbe0bf\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"Your Financial Advisor, Your Therapist ","callout":"Experts say not all money matters are black and white, and confiding in a trusted expert isn't just acceptable -- it's encouraged.","authorName":"Kathryn Tuggle","authorId":1306289,"url":"/article/your-financial-adviser-your-therapist","storyId":12786359,"publishDate":"2014-07-02T11:30:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Jul 2, 2014 7:30 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s30.postimg.org/pcdu0gwvh/psychiatrist_120x90.jpg¿","largeThumbUrl":"//s30.postimg.org/46k15vm29/psychiatrist_front_lead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card"},{"headline":"The Most Important Money Numbers: How to Improve Your Finances","callout":"From keeping an eye on your credit score to paying off debt to saving for retirement, there are a few financial numbers you need to be aware of.","authorName":"Scott Gamm","authorId":1290109,"url":"/article/most-important-numbers-money-improve-your-finances","storyId":12786361,"publishDate":"2014-07-01T21:22:30Z","publishDateAsString":"Jul 1, 2014 5:22 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/prefectcredit-120x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/perfectcredit-front-lead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-e3358761-edc6-4e48-b4ad-1fa9cc03c490\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"Renters' Insurance: Over Half of Millennials Don't Realize They Need It ","callout":"A recent study shows more than half of Millennials don't have renters insurance, even though they are the driving force behind the housing rental market.","authorName":"Amy Xie","authorId":1610030,"url":"/article/renters-insurance-over-half-millennials-dont-realize-they-need-it","storyId":12786353,"publishDate":"2014-07-01T16:40:11Z","publishDateAsString":"Jul 1, 2014 12:40 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/insurance-120x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/all-pics/mainstreet/insurance-front-lead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Credit Card"},{"headline":"Movies Cost More This Summer, and It's Not Helping","callout":"The average price of movies is still around $8, though summer blockbuster box office returns are down sharply.
