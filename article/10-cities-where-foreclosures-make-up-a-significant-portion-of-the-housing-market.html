<p>Housing data site RealtyTrac found that sales of properties in-foreclosure are down from a year ago to multi-year lows while year-to-date U.S. home sales in 2015 are at an eight-year high. The sale of properties sold while in the foreclosure process (not including bank-owned properties) accounted for 6.4% of all single family and condo sales in July, down from 6.6% of all sales in June and down from 8.0% in July 2014 to the lowest monthly share since January 2000 — the earliest that data is available.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors found that distressed properties -- including both foreclosures and short sales -- declined to 7% of all homes in July from 8% in June and 9% a year ago. Some 5% of July sales were foreclosures, and 2% were short sales. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 17% below market value in July (15% in June), while short sales were discounted 12% (18% in June). Comparatively speaking, that isn't such a bad thing.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.13162761842132586' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>"Five years ago, distressed sales represented 33% of the market in July," says Chris Polychron, president of the National Association of Realtors and executive broker with 1st Choice Realty in Hot Springs, Ark., "For many previously distressed homeowners throughout the country, rising home values in recent years have helped recover equity and the vast improvement in several local job markets means fewer are falling behind on their mortgage payments.”</p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily mean everything is going extraordinarily well. The U.S. median existing home sales price in July was $235,500, up 5.8% from a year earlier. While there are fewer all-cash sales driving that rising price, there are still reasons to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>“While the stock market may be on a roller coaster as of late, the housing market is still on solid ground, with the eight-year low in cash sales combined with the eight-year high in overall sales volume in the first half of the year evidence that housing is successfully transitioning from an investor-driven recovery to one that is drawing in traditional buyers as a good foundation for sustainable growth going forward,” says Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. “That’s not to say there are no cracks in the foundation of this recovery, the top three of which are housing affordability — or lack thereof in some high-flying markets — along with overdependence on capricious cash buyers — both foreign and domestic — in some markets, and the persistent overhang of underwater homeowners who continue to represent heightened default risk given any future economic shockwaves.”</p>

Those markets included Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Meanwhile there were 124,910 properties with foreclosure filings — default notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions — in July, up 7% from the previous month and up 14% from a year ago. However, the 45,381 U.S. properties that started the foreclosure process for the first time in July, were down 8% from the previous month and down 9% from a year ago to the lowest level since November 2005 — a nearly ten-year low. Foreclosure starts in July were less than one-fourth of their peak of 203,948 in April 2009, and below their pre-crisis average of 52,279 a month in 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>“The increase in overall foreclosure activity over the last five months has been driven primarily by rapidly rising bank repossessions, which in July reached the highest level since January 2013,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. “Meanwhile foreclosure starts in July were at the lowest level since November 2005 — a nearly ten-year low that demonstrates the recent rise in bank repossessions represents banks flushing out old distress rather than new distress being pushed into the pipeline.”</p>

<p>Foreclosures as percentage of homes sold: 12.3%</p>
<p>While actually a staggering improvement from the peak of the housing crisis, Las Vegas's glut of foreclosures is yet another sign of how long the crawl back from the bottom has been.</p>
<p>In July, the number of properties that received a foreclosure filing in Las Vegas was 17% higher than the previous month and 2% higher than the same time last year. Scheduled foreclosure auctions throughout Nevada, meanwhile, have increased 27% from a year ago. With real estate investors jumping on the cheap Las Vegas homes left in the wake of the housing crisis and turning the single-family home market into a packed field of rentals, buyers have shied away from the city just as banks have started clearing inventory. With unemployment in Las Vegas sitting at 7%, there isn't a whole lot of help coming from within, either.</p>

We have finally moved into a real market with real buyers and real sellers.”</p>
<p>The bad news is that nobody told Tampa about it. Tampa had the second-highest foreclosure rate in the country in July, with one in every 375 housing units under foreclosure. Meanwhile, foreclosure starts in Florida are up 16% from a year ago in July following ten consecutive months of year-over-year decreases, giving the state the highest foreclosure rate in the country..

<p>It is one mixed, ugly bag of real estate in Illinois. Foreclosure starts are down 18% from a year ago, but foreclosure auctions are up 19%.

<p><strong>5. Toledo, Ohio </strong></p>
<p>Foreclosures as percentage of homes sold: 15.2%</p>
<p>Toledo has plenty of reason to be unhappy with its Ohio neighbors right now. Granted, the state's foreclosure rate still ranks ninth in the country (one in every 932 housing units) and bank repossessions are up 69%, but it seems as if just about everywhere else is improving. Ohio foreclosure starts are down 22% year-over-year and much of the rest of the state is avoiding new foreclosures whenever possible.</p>
“Many of the Ohio markets have been fortunate with continued growth in sales volumes, increased employment numbers, and moderately increasing prices that are contributing factors to an overall reduction in foreclosure numbers across Ohio,” said Michael Mahon, president at HER Realtors, covering the Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus markets in Ohio. “As days on market have remained fairly low across the state, we are seeing many lending servicers acting quickly to establish communications with delinquent homeowners, and assist them in avoiding the foreclosure process.”

<p>Foreclosures as percentage of homes sold: 23.6%</p>
<p>Tons of historic buildings, beautiful Victorian homes, three colleges, the headquarters of a large regional supermarket chain and Cheerwine? How could Salisbury fall on such hard times?</p>
<p>Well, it hasn't any more so than some of the cities further down this list. Unemployment sits at a familiar 5.5%, but keep in mind that this is a city of roughly 34,000 where there isn't a whole lot of property changing hands on a regular basis. If foreclosures and bank-owned property hits the market in any decent volume, it's going to have an impact. Salisbury's key issue is that aging residents in its dense core <a href="http://www.salisburypost.com/2015/06/08/city-trying-to-find-good-owners-for-vacant-homes/">have passed on</a> and left their homes to people living outside Salisbury.

The sale of properties sold while in the foreclosure process (not including bank-owned properties) accounted for 6.4% of all single family and condo sales in July, down from 6.6% of all sales in June and down from 8.0% in July 2014 to the lowest monthly share since January 2000 — the earliest that data is available.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the National Association of Realtors found that distressed properties -- including both foreclosures and short sales -- declined to 7% of all homes in July from 8% in June and 9% a year ago. Some 5% of July sales were foreclosures, and 2% were short sales. Foreclosures sold for an average discount of 17% below market value in July (15% in June), while short sales were discounted 12% (18% in June). Comparatively speaking, that isn't such a bad thing.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.13162761842132586' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>\"Five years ago, distressed sales represented 33% of the market in July,\" says Chris Polychron, president of the National Association of Realtors and executive broker with 1st Choice Realty in Hot Springs, Ark., \"For many previously distressed homeowners throughout the country, rising home values in recent years have helped recover equity and the vast improvement in several local job markets means fewer are falling behind on their mortgage payments.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p>That doesn't necessarily mean everything is going extraordinarily well. The U.S. median existing home sales price in July was $235,500, up 5.8% from a year earlier. While there are fewer all-cash sales driving that rising price, there are still reasons to proceed with caution.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>“While the stock market may be on a roller coaster as of late, the housing market is still on solid ground, with the eight-year low in cash sales combined with the eight-year high in overall sales volume in the first half of the year evidence that housing is successfully transitioning from an investor-driven recovery to one that is drawing in traditional buyers as a good foundation for sustainable growth going forward,” says Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. “That’s not to say there are no cracks in the foundation of this recovery, the top three of which are housing affordability — or lack thereof in some high-flying markets — along with overdependence on capricious cash buyers — both foreign and domestic — in some markets, and the persistent overhang of underwater homeowners who continue to represent heightened default risk given any future economic shockwaves.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.256485075444262' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>In 61 of the 172 markets RealtyTrac analyzed for in-foreclosure sales (35%), the share of those sales increased from a year ago, counter to the national trend. Those markets included Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Meanwhile there were 124,910 properties with foreclosure filings — default notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions — in July, up 7% from the previous month and up 14% from a year ago. However, the 45,381 U.S. properties that started the foreclosure process for the first time in July, were down 8% from the previous month and down 9% from a year ago to the lowest level since November 2005 — a nearly ten-year low. Foreclosure starts in July were less than one-fourth of their peak of 203,948 in April 2009, and below their pre-crisis average of 52,279 a month in 2005 and 2006.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>“The increase in overall foreclosure activity over the last five months has been driven primarily by rapidly rising bank repossessions, which in July reached the highest level since January 2013,” said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. “Meanwhile foreclosure starts in July were at the lowest level since November 2005 — a nearly ten-year low that demonstrates the recent rise in bank repossessions represents banks flushing out old distress rather than new distress being pushed into the pipeline.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7912362296924766' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>That's good news for much of the U.S. but not for certain corners of it.
