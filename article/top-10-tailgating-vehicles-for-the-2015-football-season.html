<p>Last season, <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13283551/1/how-to-buy-nfl-tickets-without-bankrupting-yourself.html" target="_blank">NFL fans paid</a> an average of $84 for tickets to the game and $31.50 for parking, according to <em>Team Marketing Report</em>. That's a whole lot to shell out just to stuff half a dozen friends into the family sedan, stick a far-undersized grill (don't be the one who brings the campstove) and use the rest of the cargo space left over for a handful of burgers and dogs and maybe a six pack of cans that has a Hail Mary chance of making it to gametime. Even if your car doesn't have the space and amenities to make a decent tailgate work, it might be worth your time to rent or even borrow a vehicle that does.</p>
<p>Considering that the current crop of vehicles features second-row refrigerators, Wi-Fi hotspots for fantasy football updates, built-in coolers and a host of both audio and video entertainment options, it's at least worth considering an upgrade for the 2015 season. The folks at automotive pricing and buying sites Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book have each compiled lists of the cars they believe to be the best to take to a Sunday tailgate. We've taken the best of each bunch and blended them into the selection below. While they aren't the least expensive cars out there, most of them offer a surprising amount of perks and fuel efficiency for the money.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $21,795</p>
<p>When tailgating competes with warm mornings home, DirecTV's NFL Sunday Ticket, the scoring-plays-only Red Zone Channel and fantasy football leagues, it takes a lot more than seven-layer dip to drag everyone out to the stadium. The folks at Chrysler seemed to realize how hard it is to dislodge football fans from the living room and brought it to them instead.</p>
<p>Their latest take on the classic minivan includes more than 83 cubic feet of cargo space with the third-row seats down, a flip-back option for that third row that turns it into a lot-facing couch, a Blu Ray/DVD system with second and third-row screens for pre-game entertainment, and USB and aux ports for hooking up both audio and computers. Best of all, the Caravan's available Wi-Fi option not only allows folks with Sunday Ticket to stream other games through laptops, tablets and smartphones, but it makes the minivan a mobile hotspot with a 150-foot radius for all your friends following their fantasy team more closely than the teams they're paying to see.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $29,100</p>
<p>All of the little cube-shaped party boxes that were released a few years ago to entice young people into the road trips of yesteryear all failed spectacularly for one big reason: they didn't have enough room to appeal to families, older buyers and other folks who actually spend money on new cars.</p>
<p>The Flex has no such issue. Basically a minivan in a crossover's body, the Flex has room for seven, 44 inches of legroom in the second row and a power folding mechanism for getting into the third row. A surprising amount of headroom makes it easy to transport a large crew or throw some gear in the back and take a long trip all while giving them enough room to maneuver regardless of height.</p>
<p>Options such as sliding second-row captain's seats, <strong>Microsoft</strong> Sync phone, entertainment and navigation systems in its MyFord Touch screen, DVD entertainment center for the back, a multipanel sunroof, a third-row seat that flips into a rear-facing tailgate bench and second-row fridge console for road sodas compensate somewhat for its roughly 20 combined miles per gallon. It used to look like a giant Mini Cooper, but a standout frame and spacious 80 cubic feet of cargo room make it as close as you'll get to a locker room on wheels.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $21,795</p>
<p>You don't see a whole lot of tiny SUVs that look this sporty, but don't let that exterior fool you. Under the hood is a 4-cylinder, 155-horsepower engine that is every bit befitting a lightweight compact.</p>
<p>When the engine's job is getting you from here to there without a whole lot of excitement, that's where the in-car features have to do the heavy lifting. Fortunately, the CX-5 is teeming with wheel-mounted controls, Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming, HD radio, Pandora Internet radio and navigation system, pushbutton starter and three power outlets. The ample rear seating and up to 65.4 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats down aren't exactly throwaways, either, nor is the combined 30.5 miles per gallon.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $59,000</p>
<p>That 3.5-liter engine and 302 horsepower make this wagon a lot brawnier than your standard grocery-getter, but that's what you'd expect from this brand at this price.</p>
<p>German automakers don't skimp on their wagons and have embraced it as a luxurious means of shuttling the family. The COMAND touchscreen navigation and audio system, stereo cameras, radar sensors, collision prevention, attention assist, the mBrace vehicle-controlling smartphone app, rear video and DVD entertainment system and dual-zone climate control are all great hooks. However, that rear-facing row of seats makes it a great tailgate vehicle for anyone looking to bring something a little swankier to the party.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $22,995</p>
<p>Mitsubishi doesn't sell many cars in the U.S. compared to its competitors -- and, after this year, won't produce any either -- but it sells a whole bunch of this one.</p>
<p>The Outlander Sport is just a step above the base model and comes with dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera with 6-inch screen, keyless entry, push-button start, three rows of seating, 34 cubic feet of storage behind the second row and 63 behind the first. Combined with the multi-information display, heated front seats, HD Radio, Bluetooth and leather steering wheel -- and combined 27 miles per gallon -- the Outlander is Mitsubishi at its best. Sadly, however, the Outlander's latest overhaul ripped out one of its most attractive features: one of the last of the actually SUV tailgates.

<p><strong>5. 2016 Subaru Forester</strong></p>
<p>Starting price: $22,395</p>
<p>It's a great investment all around, but its high roof, hidden storage beneath the rear floor and upgraded tech features make the Forester a score for tailgating buyers.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.035949213045660566' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>A ten-year-old Forester still has more than 25% of its original value. The newer models have ever reverted to the boxy wagon look of their predecessors, while retaining the standard all-wheel-drive for Bohemian Bourgeois parents trying to balance shuttle runs to lacrosse practice with trips to Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.</p>
<p>The Forester's combined 28 miles per gallon aren't are a vast improvement over the 2013 model's 24 mpg, but its interior is bigger than both the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape and includes 34 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats up. Subaru's added Bluetooth connectivity to all its models made rearview cameras standard, added its Starlink touchscreen information and entertainment system and threw in options including a power liftgate and voice-activated GPS. It's a school shuttle, but all that space and storage comes in handy in the stadium parking lot on a Sunday.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $33,510</p>
<p>Another holdover from the SUV era, the 4Runner's sales have slumped steadily from more than 114,000 in 2004 to fewer than 76,900 last year. However, Toyota's been reversing a slide that bottomed out at fewer than 20,000 in 2011 playing to you key tailgating demographic.</p>

That last feature basically takes out the need for a folding table by providing counter space strong enough to hold 400 pounds of food and beverages. Go ahead, spring for the six-foot sub.

<p><strong>3. 2016 Honda Odyssey</strong></p>
<p>Starting price: $29,275</p>
<p>The Toyota Sienna and Odyssey have been slugging it out for families' affections for years, but the key difference for tailgaters is the Odyssey's slight space advantage. The Odyssey can carry up to eight fans with enough room behind them for a small grill. More importantly, it can carry five fans; collapse the third row and have 93.1 cubic feet for more storage. Those same fans get all the same perks, too, as the Honda's optional 16.2-inch split screen entertainment system still offers them something to stare at before kickoff.</p>

The Odyssey's removable center console offers a useful flip-up trash-bag holder, and there's also a "cool box" beverage cooler to accommodate chilled refreshments. Meanwhile, an in-cabin vacuum is an available option for fans who just know that a healthy percentage of their tailgate's snacks are going to end up on the floor.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $25,660</p>
<p>Ever wonder what's going on in the space between your pickup's cargo bed and its rear wheel fenders? Not much, which is why Ram fitted them with RamBox locking compartments with drain plugs that are advertised as mini trunks or toolboxes, but are clearly meant to be coolers.</p>
<p>Don't believe us? Ask Ram, which not only made RamBoxes waterproof and drainable, but says “both sides fit up to 240 cans of your favorite beverage in a 5'7 bed or 280 cans in a 6'4 bed configuration.” Combine that with 74.7 cubic feet cargo capacity and 1,300 to 1,600 pounds of payload capacity, and you've got yourself a party machine.</p>

That's a whole lot to shell out just to stuff half a dozen friends into the family sedan, stick a far-undersized grill (don't be the one who brings the campstove) and use the rest of the cargo space left over for a handful of burgers and dogs and maybe a six pack of cans that has a Hail Mary chance of making it to gametime. Even if your car doesn't have the space and amenities to make a decent tailgate work, it might be worth your time to rent or even borrow a vehicle that does.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Considering that the current crop of vehicles features second-row refrigerators, Wi-Fi hotspots for fantasy football updates, built-in coolers and a host of both audio and video entertainment options, it's at least worth considering an upgrade for the 2015 season. The folks at automotive pricing and buying sites Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book have each compiled lists of the cars they believe to be the best to take to a Sunday tailgate. We've taken the best of each bunch and blended them into the selection below. While they aren't the least expensive cars out there, most of them offer a surprising amount of perks and fuel efficiency for the money.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"10 SUVs to Get While Gas Is Cheap","callout":"SUV sales spiked in 2015 as gas prices slid.
