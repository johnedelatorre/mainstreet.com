<p>When you're feeling down, try reflecting on how your choice to go back to work is positively impacting your family.</p>
<p>"Mothers for whom work is a source of their life satisfaction, purpose and identity risk resenting their child if they choose to leave [their job], and mothers for whom it's financially necessary can translate the <a href="most-offensive-things-said-pregnant-women-work.html" target="_blank">guilt into pride</a> at being able to financially support her family," says Lara Honos-Webb, a clinical psychologist in the San Francisco Bay area and author of <em>Listening to Depression: How Understanding Your Pain Can Heal Your Life</em> (New Harbinger Publications, 2006). "One of the best gifts a mother can give a child is being a role model of mental health, and if working is integral to a woman's well-being, she can tell herself she is giving her child a happy, healthy mother."</p>

<p>Let's face it: Motherhood has undoubtedly added a slew of new responsibilities to your already-packed schedule. If you think you would benefit from a more flexible work arrangement, consider <a href="women-may-be-better-negotiators-than-men-old-stereotypes-die-hard.html" target="_blank">expressing</a> these desires to your employer.</p>
<p>"Figure out what is most important to you and your family and have an open and honest conversation with your employer," says Allison O'Kelly, CEO and founder of Mom Corps, a professional staffing solutions and flexible career development firm. "Is it being home at certain hours? Is it the ability to swing by a company day care at lunch time? Is it making it to doctor's appointments? Is it working from home one day a week? You might be surprised at how flexible employers might be if you just ask."</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/when-your-maternity-leave-ends-how-to-strike-a-healthy-balance-between-work-life-and-motherhood' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">
<p>When you speak with your employer about the possibility of adjusting your schedule, it's a good idea to be realistic with your expectations and come up with a solution that works for both you <em>and</em> your employer.</p>
<p>"A new mom needs to make sure they are looking at their needs as well as the needs of the employer," says O'Kelly "If there's always a team meeting on Fridays, don't ask for Fridays off. You might find that at your company Wednesdays are really slow, and it would feel more comfortable to your employer."</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7485017310310966' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>You might also want to suggest to your boss that you try out your new schedule for a trial period. This way, your boss is likely to feel more comfortable testing out a new work option and won't feel stuck with his or her decision if the arrangement doesn't work out, says O'Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>Brush Off Insensitive Comments</strong></p>
<p>If a manager or co-worker expresses doubts that you'll be able to successfully juggle work life with motherhood, try to let the <a href="most-offensive-things-said-pregnant-women-work.html" target="_blank">negative comments</a> roll right off you.</p>
<p>"Women returning to work should not be naïve about the concerns or resentments co-workers might have toward her," says Honos-Webb. "The best advice is to not take it personally and to respond directly to the underlying concern by reassuring the co-worker of your capability. New mothers should 'toot their own horn' and share with co-workers their accomplishments and current work commitments regularly."</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/when-your-maternity-leave-ends-how-to-strike-a-healthy-balance-between-work-life-and-motherhood' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Give It Time</strong></p>
<p>The first few months back from maternity leave can feel mentally and emotionally draining, but it's important to remind yourself that things will eventually improve.</p>
<p>"Don't quit—give it some time and communicate with your boss," says O'Kelly. "It will get easier."</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.881894475270564' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Bugbee says it takes about six to nine months to find your new "semi-balance" as a working mom.</p>
<p>"That really just means that you are handling those bumps in stride now, you have found a purpose in your work again and you can forgive yourself for both liking your job and not being home all day," Bugbee explains.</p>
<p><strong>Find a Support Network</strong></p>
<p>Establishing a positive support network can help give you a much-needed outlet to talk about your challenges as a working mom.</p>
<p>"Find a friend, colleague or a local parenting forum on BigTent.com, or create a working parents lunch group at work—and ask for ideas or just simply vent," says Bugbee.</p>
<p><strong>Check on Your Child (Within Reason) </strong></p>
<p>If you're anxious about your baby's well-being while you're at work, you might be tempted to call your child's nanny or day care center for an update.</p>
<p>The good news? "It's O.K. for mothers to call and check in while on breaks and to always be available for emergencies," says Claire Bissot, HR Consulting Manager at CBIZ, which provides professional business services that help clients better manage their finances and employees.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9616828575949078' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>However, Bissot warns that excessive check-ins can cause a decrease in performance and may even be in violation of employment work rules if you're checking your phone on a manufacturing floor where phones are not allowed or taking breaks every hour to call but remaining on the clock. <br > <br >  "It's important for new mothers to find their balance and comfort level, but also remember that when at work, it is time to work," Bissot says.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/when-your-maternity-leave-ends-how-to-strike-a-healthy-balance-between-work-life-and-motherhood' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Elizabeth Ochoa, chief of psychology at Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City, says it's important to have trust in your caregiver. If you know your child is in good hands, you'll have less of a reason to check in so frequently.</p>
<p>"Realize that anxiety about leaving the baby is normal and that it will subside with time," says Ochoa. "It is often helpful to have a photograph or short video of your baby that you can look at when you feel a pang."</p>
<p><strong>Take Care of Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Between caring for your little one and staying on top of your workload, it can be easy to forget about your own physical and mental health. The truth is, though, that you'll be a much better mom and worker if you make time for yourself and take care of your own personal needs.</p>

"Try to get a full eight hours of sleep every day, even if it is not all at the same time because sleep is disrupted by the baby."</p>
<p>Honos-Webb also suggests spending alone time with your partner to stay connected as a couple and engaging in "healthy pleasures" to prevent depression and retain your sense of self.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/when-your-maternity-leave-ends-how-to-strike-a-healthy-balance-between-work-life-and-motherhood' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>"It may mean going on dates with your partner, staying active in a recreational activity and watching your favorite TV show," she says.</p>
<p>If you think you might suffer from postpartum depression, which affects an estimated 9% to 16% of postpartum women, don't hesitate to see a mental health professional.</p>
<p>"Seek psychotherapy or medication consultations if your mood is depressed or you feel very emotional," says Ochoa. "It is important to rule out the possibility of postpartum depression."</p>
<p><strong>Download Apps to Save You Time </strong></p>
<p>There are many smartphone apps available that can help make your life easier as a working mom.</p>
<p>"Download any app that will alleviate weekend errands, because you'll want to spend as much time playing and enjoying your baby—not shopping," says Bugbee.</p>

Also recommended are the Instacart and Peapod apps, which allow you to arrange for grocery food delivery.</p>
