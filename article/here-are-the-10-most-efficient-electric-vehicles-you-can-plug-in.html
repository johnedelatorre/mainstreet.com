<p>If U.S. fuel efficiency standards in this country are going to hit hit 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, as the Environmental Protection Agency wants, electric vehicles are going to find themselves doing a whole lot of the heavy lifting. The average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in the in August was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.</p>
<p>While it's great that Tesla's Model X and its falcon-wing doors are going to be able to drive for 250 miles before charging, it's also not going to be here until late 2016 at the earliest. And while it's great that the Model 3 will be about $30,000 when it arrives, Tesla hasn't even mentioned a release date for it in a while. That leaves the current crop of vehicles about halfway to the benchmark that the EPA and Department of Transportation set back in 2012. However, Tesla isn't the only one falling short in the race to higher fuel efficiency. The Chevrolet Bolt that General Motors announced at the Detroit Auto Show more than a year ago claims it will offer 200 miles of electric range for $30,000 after incentives, but is still more concept than reality.</p>

Yes, range is lacking, but their efficiency and amenities are starting to stack up. With help from the EPA's <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov" target="blank">FuelEconomy.gov</a> site, we compiled a list of the most fuel-efficient electric vehicles on the road. They aren't all Tesla-caliber quite yet, but they're drifting into its class when viewed through the right lens:<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Starting price: $77,500 with incentives</p>
<p>Miles per gallon equivalent: 106 city, 95 highway, 100 combined</p>
<p>Electric charge range: 270 miles</p>
<p>Take a good look, because this is one of the few times you're going to see the Tesla at the bottom of a list like this.</p>
<p>We aren't arguing that 270 miles isn't the best electric range out there (it is). We aren't arguing that the Tesla's slew of electronic features that now include charger-oriented navigation or self-driving “autopilot” feature have an equal out there. They don't.</p>

However, it's the MPGe that we and the EPA are concerned with. It's less efficient than nine other vehicles on this list, though a supercharger and eight-year, unlimited mile warranty do a lot to make up for it.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>This is one of the best approaches in the game: take the popular midsize Focus, strip out the combustion engine and giving it all the cool electronic and mobile-based features EV owners have come to expect. Oh, and let the brakes recharge the motor a bit.</p>
<p>Throw in automatic dual-zone climate control, pushbutton start, the SYNC 3 voice-controlled communications and entertainment system and a 160-horsepower engine, and you've just transformed your staid midsize commuter special into a paragon of efficiency.

<p>Electric charge range: 93 miles</p>
<p>This boxy wagon has come a long way from dancing hamsters and LMFAO. The touchscreen UVO infotainment system and its charge status updates, charging station navigation, climate control and sound system with beat-sensing mood lighting are all secondary concerns -- as is the boasted top speed of 149 miles per hour.</p>
<p>It doesn't have the broad color palette, mix-and-match accent plates and sunroof upgrades still of the standard model, but it's still has the Soul's versatile 60/40 rear seating and 23.7 cubic feet of cargo space (49.5 with the rear seats down) that make it an ideal electric surf shack, bike shuttle or city shopping companion. The ten-year, 100,000-mile Kia warranted doesn't hurt, either.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

However, the EV came as a power convertible top or as a coupe with a panoramic roof and wasstocked with power heated exterior mirrors, rain and light sensors, a radio app and automatic temperature control. Granted, it can still take up to four and a half hours to charge it from zero, but it doesn't exactly burn through a ton of power.</p>
<p>All this said, we caution that the 2016 version widens the wheelbase, gives drivers a smartphone dock for better access to the car's myriad apps that substitute for dashboard items and adds items you likely thought were standard: Bluetooth hands-free calling, cruise control, power steering, power windows and crosswind assist for its tiny frame. None of that will bulk up this vehicle's 47 horsepower, however, but it may make it a bit more livable.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

However, with 85 cubic feet of passenger room and 13 cubic feet of trunk space, it's as big as the smallest Prius and similarly useful.

<p>This car has spent a half decade on the road, and its continued lack of a supercharger makes that fact painfully apparent. However, for folks without a long commute and who live along electric corridors with lots of car chargers, it's ideal.</p>
<p>A bevy of audio, navigation and app support features – including maps of nearby charging station -- are now fairly standard among the competition. The LEAF is just as silent, though, and is still one of the best EV options available for the money.

<p>It's as zippy as the Fiat at 140 horsepower but doesn't break $20,000 after incentives. Not bad for GM's tiny electric wonder.</p>
<p>The Spark looks like a spartan subcompact from the outside, and its EV version doesn't get a full charge for seven hours using even its most powerful charger. However, it has 23.4 cubic feet of storage with the rear seats down, a 7-inch diagonal high-resolution color touch-screen, Bluetooth wireless, Apple Siri Eyes Free texting and a standard three years of OnStar remote link access that lets owners check battery level, efficiency statistics and more on their smartphones.

<p><strong>1. 2015 BMW i3</strong></p>
<p>MSRP: $41,350</p>
<p>Miles per gallon equivalent: 137 city, 111 highway, 124 combined</p>
<p>Electric charge range: 81 miles</p>
<p>It's incredibly efficient even without an available, on-board gas generator that doubles the vehicle's 81-mile range -- which we have to note is still well below the Tesla's 270 miles. Made with lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber, the i3 is far lighter than most other EVs and requires a smaller battery consuming less energy. Thus, its 124 miles per gallon equivalent is actually far more efficient than the Model S's 100 mpge, even if the latter has greater range. The crew at Edmunds managed to get 96 miles worth of range out of the standard battery and 150 with the extender.</p>
<p>The i3 also packs 170 horsepower of performance and tons of interior space in an electric ride rivaled in speed by only the Tesla Model S. There is room for four full-size adults to fit comfortably, while the fold-flat makes the i3 surprisingly practical. With lots of luxury amenities that BMW customers have come to expect, the i3 beats the Model S in one big area: price. That $42,000 still isn't cheap, but it has some upside.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

The average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in the in August was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>While it's great that Tesla's Model X and its falcon-wing doors are going to be able to drive for 250 miles before charging, it's also not going to be here until late 2016 at the earliest. And while it's great that the Model 3 will be about $30,000 when it arrives, Tesla hasn't even mentioned a release date for it in a while. That leaves the current crop of vehicles about halfway to the benchmark that the EPA and Department of Transportation set back in 2012. However, Tesla isn't the only one falling short in the race to higher fuel efficiency. The Chevrolet Bolt that General Motors announced at the Detroit Auto Show more than a year ago claims it will offer 200 miles of electric range for $30,000 after incentives, but is still more concept than reality.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.12617784940189003' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Maybe instead of looking for the splashiest new electric vehicle, we should take a closer look at the incremental gains being made by the crop that's already out there. Yes, range is lacking, but their efficiency and amenities are starting to stack up. With help from the EPA's <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov\" target=\"blank\">FuelEconomy.gov<\u002fa> site, we compiled a list of the most fuel-efficient electric vehicles on the road.

the vehicle's 81-mile range -- which we have to note is still well below the Tesla's 270 miles. Made with lightweight aluminum and carbon fiber, the i3 is far lighter than most other EVs and requires a smaller battery consuming less energy. Thus, its 124 miles per gallon equivalent is actually far more efficient than the Model S's 100 mpge, even if the latter has greater range. The crew at Edmunds managed to get 96 miles worth of range out of the standard battery and 150 with the extender.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The i3 also packs 170 horsepower of performance and tons of interior space in an electric ride rivaled in speed by only the Tesla Model S. There is room for four full-size adults to fit comfortably, while the fold-flat makes the i3 surprisingly practical. With lots of luxury amenities that BMW customers have come to expect, the i3 beats the Model S in one big area: price. That $42,000 still isn't cheap, but it has some upside.<\u002fp><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-the-10-most-efficient-electric-vehicles-you-can-plug-in' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"7 Spacious Rides Under $20K","callout":"Here are some great, spacious rides that can be bought new for under $20,000.","authorName":"David Seaman","authorId":1164657,"url":"/slideshow/10-totally-spacious-rides-under-20000","storyId":12809349,"publishDate":"2009-10-23T17:06:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Oct 23, 2009 1:06 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/mainstreet-photos/photo-gallery/art-gallery/elantra3.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/mainstreet-photos/photo-gallery/art-gallery/elantra1.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-1b94853d-428c-46b2-82f4-bbf0b245f183\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"Selling a Used Car?
