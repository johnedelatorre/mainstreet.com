<p>That's according to MoneyRates.com, which ranked the top ten states to retire in the U.S. The best states made the list not only for their weather and low crime rates, but also because of tax rates, the cost of living, how many of their peers seniors can expect to find and life expectancy. To check out the full rankings, click <a href="http://www.money-rates.com/research-center/best-states-for-retirement/" target="blank">here</a> or continue reading below.</p>
<p>“We looked at a range of five different factors, because we recognize that a number of things go into these decisions, but how you weigh those factors is an individual decision,” said Richard Barrington, senior financial analyst for MoneyRates.com, a personal finance website based in Foster City, Calif.</p>

While retirees are drawn to the weather in Florida and Arizona, both states have higher costs of living and taxes, which can siphon into their hard-earned savings.</p>
<p>In the MoneyRates.com study, Alaska earned the bottom spot in the study and ranked below average for all five factors the study measured. The high cost of living doesn't help and most people don't want to retire where few seniors live in the state.</p>
<p>One of the main drawbacks affecting both Louisiana and Tennessee is its high crime rate and low life expectancy, dragging both to the bottom ten in the survey.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/you-can-ruin-your-retirement-if-youre-living-in-this-state" target="blank" data-add-tracking="true">Illinois ranked as the fourth worst state to retire</a> and its proportion of older people compared to the state's population is well below average. Its tepid job market is a definite drawback as more older Americans are seeking a part-time job to supplement their retirement income.</p>

<p>"In comparison to many other states, Illinois has high property taxes and an estate tax," she said. "There are many other states in which retirees can get more for their money. This translates into residents saving less for retirement and burning through their savings faster."</p>
<p>Nevada, Georgia, Maryland, New York, Michigan and Alabama made the list of the worst places to live in retirement because of their high taxes and crime rates, weak economies and low life expectancy for older residents.

<p>Income taxes can be important depending upon your level of retirement income, said Clarence Kehoe, a CPA with Anchin, Block &amp; Anchin's tax Department in New York.</p>
<p>"Certain states have no income tax and are retirement havens, especially for those in higher tax brackets," he said. "Some states have special tax breaks for retirees and their income."</p>

<p>"If moving across a state line materially affects the cost of living or your tax rate, you might be able to improve your retirement conditions while still living fairly close to your loved ones," said Barrington.</p>
<p>If high taxes or crime rates or the lack of many retirees living in a state bothers you, then moving may not be such a bad idea, he said.</p>
<p>"One reason we do this kind of study is that people tend to talk about the American economy and the American condition as if things were pretty much the same wherever you go," Barrington said. "They are not. Conditions vary greatly from state to state and people should know that there are alternatives."</p>
<p>Investing for your retirement when you are young is the best strategy, said Bill DeShurko, a portfolio manager on Covestor, the online investing platform with offices in Boston and London.<br >  <br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/these-top-ten-states-for-retirement-can-boost-your-health-and-preserve-your-wealth' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>"Wealth is created from income and rarely from investment gains," he said. "When you are young, most expenses are purely discretionary. You may not want to save, but you can by making tough choices."</p>

<p>"Don't be greedy," he said." A 7% return on $10,000 at age 30 turns to $160,000 at age 70. At 9%, the same $10,000 would be $320,000 - twice as much from just a net 2% better return. You can get rich slowly when time is still on your side."</p>
<p>While the cost of homes and access to doctors are important, people should think about if they want to move away from their friends and family or live closer to their children, Kahn said. "You need to have a support system and you can't rank for that," he said.</p>
