<p><a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/video/how-bad-are-americans-when-it-comes-to-financial-literacy" target="_blank">Financial literacy education</a> in America is in a state of disrepair. Although millions of students learn about the Teapot Dome Scandal and other facts of life from the last century, <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/looking-to-get-financially-literate-dont-expect-business-educators-to-help" target="_blank">few schools think to sit them down</a> and have a conversation about the impact of credit card debt and variable interest rates. What few programs exist tend to cover money as a terminally boring subject, turning off students to one of the few subjects absolutely everyone will need to know.</p>
<p>These boring programs are actually the success stories. Most schools don’t touch the subject at all, financial management not being a priority for schools struggling just to keep the math department open. Parents don’t pick up the ball either. As Jack Kosakowski, CEO of Junior Achievement has pointed out in the past, for many parents finances are <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/are-you-ready-to-have-the-talk-with-your-kids-its-not-what-you-think" target="_blank">worse than the sex talk</a>. They would rather go over the birds and the bees in horrifying, illustrated detail than have a frank conversation about household budgets.</p>

<p>A few companies are trying to do just that. While most teachers ignore the subject and a few others bust out the Excel spreadsheets, these seven companies are getting… creative with financial literacy. <br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-weird-ways-companies-are-trying-to-teach-teens-about-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The online piggybank with a sonically-imposing name, Oink is spreading the word about personal finance through the power of song.</p>
<p>Recently the company announced its partnership with the teen R&amp;B group History in the Making. “Oink users will be the first to have access to exclusive content,” the company wrote in its press release, while promising that “the dynamic vocal trio will support the message of financial empowerment throughout their video content and multiple social media platforms.”</p>
<p>The company is going full steam ahead with their new partnership. History’s first collaboration video "Walk Away" has already dropped, featuring <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/delinquent-student-loans-get-out-of-detention" target="_blank">the boys escaping from detention</a> and charming the girls at their high school while stopping, periodically, to make purchases through their prominently branded digital wallets.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Literacy Music</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t a category but the name of a business. Financial Literacy Music is the brainchild of Great Ideas Edutainment, LLC. It offers a <a href="http://www.financialliteracymusic.com/Financial-Literacy-Music.html" target="_blank">complete curriculum</a> on financial literacy taught, as the name suggests, through hip hop songs. Think didactic Raffi, but with an edge for credit card-wielding big kids.</p>
<p>Students can learn about money basics through tracks such as "Mr. Bad Debt," "Yearning for Earnings" and "<a href="../taxes.html" target="_blank">Tactics to Taxes</a>," a song about taxes and tax planning. That last is a subject we can all feel some sympathy for at this time of year.</p>
<p>Founded by self-described “edutainer” Johnny Deas, Financial Literacy Music offers a surprisingly thorough course of studies for a program taught entirely via iPod. At the risk of sounding judgmental, writing a lesson plan on estate planning in rhyming lyrics seems ambitious. It’s asking quite a lot from a catchy hook to keep someone humming his “17 learning objectives” and “27-question knowledge assessment” about life insurance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.practicalmoneyskills.com/downloads/Marvel_Worksheet.pdf" target="_blank">The Hulk’s Budget Blaster</a></strong></p>
<p>We’ve written about <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/get-rich-comic-books-fantasy-investing" target="_blank">Marvel’s financial literacy comic book</a> in the past, but even so, our first reaction was to assume that this was some sort of late night exercise equipment, or maybe an experimental breakfast cereal.</p>
<p>Quite possibly both.</p>
<p>Sadly it’s neither. Instead the Budget Blaster (maybe a new type of palatably-priced frozen dessert?) is a budgeting spreadsheet featuring the Incredible Hulk. The system seems to work on two theories: first, that by giving kids a chance to write out their spending in detail, they’ll be able to find valuable patterns in their own behavior. Second, that where numbers fail, a picture of the Incredible Hulk ready to know someone into next Tuesday will succeed.</p>
<p>And who can argue with results? If your eight-year-old starts getting the shakes at the mere thought of frivolous spending, then the Hulk’s work here is done.</p>

<p>When I was in first grade our teacher set up a classroom economy. Students could earn classroom bucks by doing various chores around the room, and we were allowed to set up small shops for spending that money. I established the classroom bank and started giving out high interest loans to anybody who wanted to buy a new pencil sharpener.</p>

<p>Kidzania is a little bit like that. This chain of theme parks builds entire child-sized cities in which children do jobs, earn “kidzos” and spend that money as they'd like. Available jobs include bottling Coca-Cola, flipping burgers at a McDonald's and manufacturing Quaker granola bars. It’s a bold experiment, evidently, in education by cautionary example.</p>
<p>After all, parents can scold and scold all day and night, but nothing beats actually shoving that Swiffer brand mop into your son’s hands and saying “time to start working off that credit card debt, Jimmy! I’ll see you at five.”</p>
<p>Or, as they say in Kidzania, “Have a productive day!”</p>

<p>For some reason people really seem invested in the idea that teens want their financial education delivered in verse. Who knows, maybe if our banks played catchier music in the lobby, we could have avoided the 2008 crisis. Someday we may all speak in hushed tones about the Macklemore’s <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/grammy-winners-show-thrift-hot" target="_blank">visionary treatise</a> on personal responsibility, "Thrift Shop."</p>

<p>Well, the Boys and Girls Club of America partnered up with Charles Schwab a little while back and decided to get a piece of that action. Together they created M4: The Money Matters Music Moguls contest in which teens competed to write the best track about financial literacy.</p>
<p>Blake McGuire, a 15-year-old from Indianapolis, took home the prize when his song "Money All That Matters" got over 100,000 votes. Whatever else can be said about the surprisingly booming genre of accountant-rock, clearly some kids are paying attention.</p>

<p>What says sound financial planning better than a cartoon vampire who wants to discuss kittens? If you said a cartoon vampire who wants to talk about kittens and is so mired in student debt that he decides to open up a nightclub, then you may be the target audience of Bite Nightclub.</p>
<p>Financial literacy games are an increasingly common field. Educators have found that students respond better to engagement than lectures, and personal accounting can be a rather dull subject if not handled right. The success of these games ranges. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/freedom-quest-making-financial-literacy-fun" target="_blank">Some</a> never get off the ground, <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/11899156/1/financial-football-tackles-financial-literacy.html?cm_ven=yahoop" target="_blank">some do well</a> and some are just plain weird.</p>

I’ll give you a hint: your mission is to “get your vampire guests what they want so they have a good time… [and] get them all fist pumping on the dance floor” before they “go bat crazy and trash your club.” While you’re at it, make sure to keep the checkbook balanced too.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, we should also take a moment to recognize opportunity lost when no one at Financial Entertainment suggested the name Bite Club.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.funnymoneyinc.com/" target="_blank">Funny Money</a></strong></p>
<p>Should we be teaching our children the value of money through a program named after forged $20 bills? Clearly, in the minds of Funny Money, Inc., the answer to this question is a resounding yes. What financial literacy has been missing all along has been, apparently, a sense of humor.</p>
<p>(And who are we to argue? After all, half of this list is based on the idea that financial literacy’s number one problem is the lack of a danceable beat.)</p>
<p>Funny Money, Inc. is, in its own words, “North America’s #1 FUN-ancial Lecture For Students.” The <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/corinthian-colleges-canadian-subsidiary-files-for-bankruptcy-and-shuts-down-its-schools" target="_blank">Ontario-based</a> comedy trio tours around putting on a routine that mashes together a standup comedy act with the basics of money management. Teachers who aren’t in Ontario but would like a taste of the glamorous world of standup accounting can download the Funny Money toolkit and lesson plan. Jokes, unfortunately, do not seem to be included.<br >  <br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-weird-ways-companies-are-trying-to-teach-teens-about-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>
