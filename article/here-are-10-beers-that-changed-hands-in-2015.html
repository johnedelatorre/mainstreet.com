<p>In a year when beer's optimists would rather focus on the more than 4,100 breweries in the U.S., the 1.5 opening each day and the super-sweet <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2903">federal tax excise tax break</a> that the beer industry is trying to cut for itself with help from Congress, there has been tremendous upheaval. We've said that craft beer will be <a href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-craft-beer-will-be-almost-unrecognizable-by-the-year-2020/">unrecognizable by 2020</a>, but this year's <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13296799/1/say-goodbye-to-craft-beer-as-you-know-it.html">slate of acquisitions</a> has made it difficult to recognize as it is.</p>
<p>When folks in the industry look back at 2015, they'll remember it as the year when legislation was finally drafted to reduce the federal beer excise tax to $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels produced by domestic brewers producing fewer than 2 million barrels. They'll also remember it for cutting that same tax to $16 per barrel on the first 6 million barrels for all other brewers. Isn't it great that we leveled the playing field beneath that $18-per-barrel excise tax for any barrels beyond 6 million?</p>

Meanwhile, when it came to issues like beer distribution -- that actually affect the availability and price of beer -- everybody stayed fairly mum. Granted, Kentucky threw brewers out of its state's distribution business, but other states have been loath to do the same. In fact, the Justice Department and state regulators in California are looking into allegations that Anheuser-Busch InBev is buying up distributors to prevent small craft brewers from reaching stores and bars.</p>
<p>It took Anheuser-Busch InBev's purchase of SABMiller for $108 billion and its decision to take a 30% share of the global beer market to jar at least some beer consumers into realizing that something is afoot. Sure, there's still going to be a Senate committee hearing about it, and there are still antitrust hurdles to clear, but it's just a nice reminder that -- since the beginning of the year -- there have been deals involving 13 of the Top 50 breweries in the United States. Some of it can be filed under consolidation, some of it involves private equity investment that could result it a sale at some other time and some of it involved selling a brewery to its employees through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).</p>

<p><strong>Founders Brewing Company</strong></p>
<p>Grand Rapids, Mich.</p>
<p>Sold to: Mahou San Miguel (30% stake)</p>
<p>No, this wasn't a complete buyout, but it did come as a bit of a shock to the craft beer community when it was announced at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Founded in 1997, Founders had growing into a more than 190,000 barrel operation behind the strength of beers including All Day IPA, Breakfast Stout, Dirty Bastard Scotch Ale, Centennial IPA and Kentucky Bourbon Stout. However, when founders Mike Stevens and Dave Engbers began thinking about their legacy, succession plan and the next 20 years, they began looking into options before linking up with the folks behind Spanish brewer Mahou San Miguel. They liked it as an opportunity to grow their operations with a little extra money, they liked the opportunity to increase their presence abroad and they liked the idea of working with a family owned brewery.</p>

However, it waited until the deal went final, which was coincidentally just after craft beer production numbers for 2014 were finalized.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Elysian Brewing Company</strong></p>
<p>Seattle</p>
<p>Sold to: Anheuser-Busch InBev</p>
<p>If the beer industry is an adult soap opera, the Elysian sale was a telenovela during sweeps week.</p>
<p>Opened in 1996, Elysian situated itself as an anti-establishment beer. It teamed up with Sub Pop Records on its Loser Pale Ale (with the now infamous Corporate Beer Sucks tagline), its co-founder Dick Cantwell was active with the Brewers Association and actively fought for small brewers and it produced bold, boundary-breaking beers like Space Dust IPA, Superfuzz Blood Orange and an entire line of pumpkin beers during the fall.</p>
<p>However, when Cantwell ran into an A-B rep at a conference and that rep prodded him about a deal, he did what he felt was the right thing and reported the new to co-founders Dave Buhler and Joe Bissaca. They were far more enthusiastic than Cantwell was about it, and the deal went final in January... just before A-B aired a Super Bowl ad for Budweiser mocking craft beer and “Pumpkin Peach Ale.” It was not lost on Cantwell that his brewers had brewed Gourdgia On My Mind, a pumpkin peach ale, just a few months earlier. Cantwell shrugged off a bigger payday from A-B and left the company early. Elysian, meanwhile, has since expanded its availability to the East Coast.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Los Angeles</p>
<p>Sold to: Anheuser-Busch In-Bev</p>
<p>Never heard of Golden Road, you say? Well, founders Meg Gill and Tony Yanow only opened for business in 2011. The IPA-heavy brewery was slated to brew 45,000 barrels this year before Anheuser-Busch InBev swept in back in September.</p>
<p>While Anheuser-Busch InBev had previously purchased Elysian, Oregon-based 10 Barrel, Long Island's Blue Point and Chicago's Goose Island, it had a noticeable blank spot on its map in California. This brewery's stylish tallboy cans and presence in relatively craft-devoid Los Angeles made it especially appealing, even if scrutiny of A-B's distribution practices was making California a little uncomfortable at the time. The oddest thing about this transaction, however, was that A-B wasn't the first one into California this year.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Saint Archer Brewing Company</strong></p>
<p>San Diego</p>
<p>Sold to: MillerCoors</p>
<p>In fact, A-B wasn't even the first large brewer to buy a young, IPA-heavy brewery in California that month.</p>
<p>Earlier in September, MillerCoors announced that it was buying Saint Archer after that brewery had spent just two years in business. With 35,000 barrels in sales, a prime location in craft-friendly San Diego, but only a modest attachment to the city after a series of missteps that included voicing support for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Saint Archer was considered a malleable steal at an estimated $35 million.</p>

That made MillerCoors confident enough to make its first craft beer acquisition since Miller bought stakes in both Austin, Texas-based Celis and Portland, Maine-based Shipyard in 1995. Granted, it ended up selling Shipyard and folding Celis five years later, but a whole lot has changed for Miller Coors during that span.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Firestone Walker Brewing Company</strong></p>
<p>Paso Robles, Calif.</p>
<p>Sold to: Duvel Moortgat</p>
<p>It's rare that craft beer folks cheer a deal with another brewery, but Belgium's Duvel Moortgat isn't just some other brewery.</p>
<p>Duvel dates back to 1871 and has been in the Moortgat family that entire time. It already had a presence in the U.S. after helping found Cooperstown, N.Y.-based Brewery Ommegang in the late '90s and purchased Kansas City-based Boulevard in 2013. Duvel chief executive Michel Moortgat had developed a relationship with Adam Firestone and David Walker, who founded Firestone Walker in 1996, and Walker reached out to Duvel USA at the Craft Brewer's Conference in Portland, Ore., earlier this year about problems he was having with expansion and capacity.</p>

<p>San Diego</p>
<p>Sold to: Constellation Brands</p>
<p>Tell me if any of this sounds familiar: founded in 1996, home to prestigious beers including Sculpin IPA, Big Eye IPA and Victory At Sea Imperial Porter, with a big presence in California.</p>
<p>Constellation Brands basically had the Grupo Modelo brands handed to it by the Justice Department after it found Anheuser-Busch InBev's $20.1 billion purchase of them a violation of antitrust law. However, it had to shell out an estimated $1 billion to get its hands on a brewer that produced 123,000 barrels last year, produced arguably this summer's most sought-after craft beer in Grapefruit Sculpin and hinted that it might have to consider selling shares and going public to fund its expansion. It went public, all right, but under the same roof as Corona and Pacifico.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Hood River, Ore.</p>
<p>Sold to: Encore Consumer Capital</p>
<p>Perhaps Oregon was still feeling the aftershocks of Bend-based 10 Barrel's sale to Anheuser-Busch InBev in late 2014, but this sale should have been a lot more surprising than it was.</p>
<p>Full Sail had been operating in Hood River since 1987 and had built itself largely on brewmaster Jaime Emmerson's portfolio of German-style lagers and, more recently, its Session lagers and ales. Also, during a particularly trying stretch in 1999, it had sold shares to its employees under an ESOP program to keep itself from being sold or acquired. That's what made owner Irene Firmat's announcement of a vote on a proposed deal by San Francisco-based Encore so surprising: not only were she and Emmerson selling, but the employee shareholders were as well.</p>
<p>The deal went through, and, for much of 2015, Full Sail has been in the Encore portfolio beside Mesa tortillas, Fantasy Cookie Company, California Splendor frozen strawberries and MyChelle Dermaceuticals.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/here-are-10-beers-that-changed-hands-in-2015' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Its IPA helped create the West Coast IPA as we know it. Its beers -- including Hop Stoopid, Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale and Brown Shugga -- helped push the envelope and advance U.S. beer to the point it's reached today.</p>
<p>It pushed for more extensive distribution, it placed a brewery in Chicago and it made plans for another brewery that would push it well beyond the 1 million-barrel threshold. Its founder Tony Magee, has also been a vocal and vehement proponent of craft beer and opponent of large breweries and consolidation. However, despite scrapping with fellow craft brewers over trademarks and lambasting small brewers for selling to Anheuser-Busch InBev and others, Magee made the decision to sell half of his company to one of the largest brewers in the world based on his reading of the beer market going forward.</p>

<p>Longmont, Colo., and Brevard, N.C.</p>
<p>Sold to: Fireman Capital (controlling stake)</p>
<p>It was one of the first craft brewers to can beer back in 2002, it was the first craft brewer west of the Mississippi to open an East Coast brewery since Redhook in 1995 and it makes forays into NASCAR, bicycle fabrication, coffee roasting and restaurants that many of its contemporaries can't or won't.</p>
<p>However, owner Dale Katechis -- he of Dale's Pale Ale -- realized he wasn't immortal and might need a business partner to not only help fund his future endeavors, but to provide a succession plan if his children didn't want to take over. In typically boisterous fashion, Oskar Blues announced its partnership with Boston-based Fireman Capital -- which also has a stake in the Salt Lake City-based Utah Brewers Cooperative and its Wasatch and Squatters beers -- by also announcing that Oskar Blues would be purchasing Perrin Brewing in Comstock Park, Mich.</p>
<p>Oskar Blues has expanded its portfolio this to include a new IPA and session IPA and will be expanding its footprint once again by opening a new brewery in Austin, Texas, in 2016.

<p>Chicago</p>
<p>Sold to: Molson Coors (remaining share of joint venture)</p>
<p>How badly did Anheuser-Busch InBev want SABMiller and its expanding African, Asian and Latin American markets? Enough to get SABMiller to sell its 58% stake in its MillerCoors North American joint venture with Molson Coors for $12.1 billion.</p>
<p>Considering that A-B picked up Grupo Modelo in 2013 for $20.1 billion and Modelo's 6% of the U.S. market was a fraction of MillerCoors's 26% share, $12.1 billion is basically a clearance sale price for a huge chunk of U.S. beer sales. While it's true that the Miller light lager brands have been in slow decline for a number of years, former Miller holdings like Redd's and Leinenkugel's are absolute stars in the MillerCoors portfolio. With recent pickups like Crispin cider and Saint Archer and new additions including Smith &amp; Forge cider, MillerCoors had a lot of reason for optimism before the SABMiller deal.</p>
<p>With the joint venture reduced to a single entity, MillerCoors can move forward in a more linear, simplified fashion and can be more innovative and nimble than when it was answering to two masters.

They'll also remember it for cutting that same tax to $16 per barrel on the first 6 million barrels for all other brewers. Isn't it great that we leveled the playing field beneath that $18-per-barrel excise tax for any barrels beyond 6 million?<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.02487566023503829' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>No, because your drinkers not only barely know what you're talking about, but also will never see a dime of savings come their way. Meanwhile, when it came to issues like beer distribution -- that actually affect the availability and price of beer -- everybody stayed fairly mum. Granted, Kentucky threw brewers out of its state's distribution business, but other states have been loath to do the same. In fact, the Justice Department and state regulators in California are looking into allegations that Anheuser-Busch InBev is buying up distributors to prevent small craft brewers from reaching stores and bars.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>It took Anheuser-Busch InBev's purchase of SABMiller for $108 billion and its decision to take a 30% share of the global beer market to jar at least some beer consumers into realizing that something is afoot. Sure, there's still going to be a Senate committee hearing about it, and there are still antitrust hurdles to clear, but it's just a nice reminder that -- since the beginning of the year -- there have been deals involving 13 of the Top 50 breweries in the United States. Some of it can be filed under consolidation, some of it involves private equity investment that could result it a sale at some other time and some of it involved selling a brewery to its employees through employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.6570936505562419' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>However, brewery acquisitions alone were enough to keep the beer industry busy this year, change the ranks of craft brewers and alter availability to the consumer and presentation at bars, restaurants and stores.

It teamed up with Sub Pop Records on its Loser Pale Ale (with the now infamous Corporate Beer Sucks tagline), its co-founder Dick Cantwell was active with the Brewers Association and actively fought for small brewers and it produced bold, boundary-breaking beers like Space Dust IPA, Superfuzz Blood Orange and an entire line of pumpkin beers during the fall.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>However, when Cantwell ran into an A-B rep at a conference and that rep prodded him about a deal, he did what he felt was the right thing and reported the new to co-founders Dave Buhler and Joe Bissaca. They were far more enthusiastic than Cantwell was about it, and the deal went final in January... just before A-B aired a Super Bowl ad for Budweiser mocking craft beer and “Pumpkin Peach Ale.” It was not lost on Cantwell that his brewers had brewed Gourdgia On My Mind, a pumpkin peach ale, just a few months earlier. Cantwell shrugged off a bigger payday from A-B and left the company early.
