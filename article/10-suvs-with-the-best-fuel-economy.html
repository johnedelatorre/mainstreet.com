<p>Vehicle fuel efficiency standards are inching toward the Environmental Protection Agency's goal of a combined 54.5 miles per gallon for company fleets by 2025, but moving the trucked-up SUV to a car's frame and dubbing it a “crossover” has helped immensely. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute found that cars and light trucks purchased in 2014 got an average of 25.4 miles to the gallon. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that it set back in 2012, but it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980.</p>
<p>Give crossovers a whole lot of thanks for that. Automakers sold more than 2.5 million of them in the U.S. through July -- with a big assist from fuel prices that are down an average of 90 cents per gallon from this time a year ago. That makes crossovers the single largest class of vehicle ahead of midsize cars (2.1 million sold through July), small cars (1.9 million) pickups (1.4 million) and all non-crossover SUVs combined (970,000).</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9971943699648655' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Crossover sales are up 14% year-to-date over last year, but that doesn't mean every SUV is exactly a lean, green machine. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the six-cylinder, supercharged Volkswagen Toureg Hybrid -- a car that doesn't even rely on its gas-powered engine 100% of the time -- still only manages a scant 21 miles per gallon combined. That's the same mileage as a four-wheel-drive Nissan Pathfinder, which isn't exactly a bastion of fuel economy.</p>
<p>With help from the EPA's <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov" target="blank">FuelEconomy.gov</a> site, we compiled a list of the most fuel-efficient SUVs currently being sold. Models with limited availability like the BYD e6 or the Toyota RAV4 EV didn't make the list this year but may when they become more widely available in the future. There are hybrid and diesel vehicles on this list, but as we'll make clear, hybrid engines and alternative fuels are no guarantee of fuel efficiency:<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>10. 2016 Hyundai Tuscon Eco</strong></p>
<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $24,150</p>
<p><strong>EPA combined city and highway mileage:</strong> 29.5 mpg</p>
<p>Hyundai knows its way around lightweight aluminum and has made a name for itself by offering cars with incredible mileage at minimal cost. However, this four-cylinder turbocharged engine manages 175 horsepower while minimizing fuel intake.</p>

Yet that efficiency still comes with the same 61.9 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats down, side-mirror turn signals, fog lights, LED daytime running lights and ten-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty as some of the more expensive, less efficient options.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>9. 2015 Chevrolet Trax</strong></p>
<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $20,120</p>
<p><strong>EPA combined city and highway mileage:</strong> 30 mpg</p>
<p>What's a Chevy Trax, you ask? Don't worry: if this compact SUV isn't exactly familiar, it's because it only arrived during the 2015 model year as the downmarket complement to the Buick encore -- which is built on the same frame.</p>
<p>It looks like a Chevy Sonic, because it's basically a beefed-up version of Chevy's subcompact. Like the Sonic, however, the Trax gets by on its fuel-sipping 1.4-liter engine and on a laundry list of tech perks. The OnStar communicationsystem comes standard and turns the Trax into a rolling 4G hotspot, while the Chevrolet MyLink gives drivers access to a host of apps via a 7-inch touchscreen. Combined with Apple's Siri Eyes Free voice texting, an OnStar remote link app for your smartphone and 48.4 cubic feet of storage with the seats down, all of the above makes the Trax the efficient urban wagon Chevy's been dreaming of. Just know that if you decide to go with the all-wheel-drive version, that mileage drops to less than 25 mpg.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $23,445</p>
<p><strong>EPA combined city and highway mileage:</strong> 30.5 mpg</p>
<p>We end up writing about this car and its competitors, the Ford Escape and Toyota RAV4, a lot. But station wagons received a lot of press in the '70s, minvans soaked up a whole lot of ink in the '80s and far larger SUVs garnered attention in the '90s for much the same reason... they're the family cars for their time.</p>
<p>The CR-V is the top-selling small crossover in the country (194,000 through July, just ahead of the Escape's 175,000 and RAV4's 170,000) because it just does its job well. It has a reasonable-for-its-class entry price, it's incredibly fuel efficient -- though all-wheel drive drops that to 25 miles per gallon -- and it gives families everything they're looking for. After the popular crossover's 2012 overhaul, it's it added a leather interior, moonroof, Pandora-connected information display, heated seats and rearview windows and navigation system with controls mounted on the steering wheel. Oh, and there's still 70 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. This list surrounds the CR-V with similarly efficient competition, but this vehicle is still the small crossover standard.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $21,795</p>
<p><strong>EPA combined city and highway mileage:</strong> 30.5 mpg</p>
<p>You don't see a whole lot of tiny SUVs that look this sporty, but don't let that exterior fool you. Under the hood is a 4-cylinder, 155-horsepower engine that is every bit befitting a lightweight compact.</p>
<p>When the engine's job is getting you from here to there without a whole lot of excitement, that's where the inc-car features have to do the heavy lifting. Fortunately, the CX-5 is teeming with wheel-mounted controls, Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming, HD radio, Pandora Internet radio and navigation system, pushbutton starter and three power outlets. The ample rear seating and up to 65.4 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats down aren't exactly throwaways, either.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The crossover of choice for America's swankier zip codes likes to call itself a Sport Activity Vehicle, apparently because “utility” is for the help.</p>
<p>With the 4-cylinder, 180-horsepower diesel engine cutting down on consumption and 27.6 cubic feet of shopping-bag space folding out to 63.3 cubic feet of lacrosse-gear storage, the X3 gives the appearance of a Whole Foods-bound grocery getter. However, the leather interior, a panoramic moonroof, automatic front climate control with separate left and right temperature settings, power tailgate, front and rear parking distance sensors, rearview camera, HD radio, Sirius-XM satellite radio, Bluetooth with Mobile Office functions and BMW TeleService, the X3 is as packed with perks as one would expect from BMW. However, given the number of BMW's luxury competitors that appear further up the list, we're kind of surprised this is the only diesel that made the cut.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>We'll start off by noting that this is a monstrous vehicle getting this kind of mileage. Despite a 3.5-liter V6 engine that generates a whopping 295 horsepower, this still, somehow, manages to get 32 miles per gallon in the city.</p>
<p>It's 11 miles per gallon more efficient than a base, gas-only RX 350, it puts out 20 horsepower more and its has the same 80.3 cubic inches of cargo space with the seats folded.

<p>We'll note that the 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine for the front-wheel drive model is the only one that gets anything close to this kind of mileage. The five-cylinder all-wheel-drive upgrade cuts combined mileage to less than 25 miles per gallon, but the base still gets you 43.8 cubic feet of cargo space, 3,500 pounds of towing capacity power driver's and front-passengers' seats, power moonroof and an audio and communications system with a 7-inch touchscreen.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>We bid farewell to the wonderful Honda Crosstour wagon -- an inefficient relic of a bygone era -- and usher in the HR-V with tremendous enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The CR-V's little sibling has 58.8 cubic feet of cargo room with the seats down (not including the front passenger's seat, which folds down for longer items), LED brake lights, heated side mirrors, the HondaLink app suite, a 7-inch touchscreen entertainment and communications center, voice texting, wheel-mounted controls, multi-angle rearview camera and options including a power moonroof, heated seats and automatic climate control.

<p>Subaru's first stab at a hybrid was incredibly effective, especially considering that every car it makes comes in all-wheel drive.</p>
<p>This mini-crossover is a throwback to the Subaru Outback's earliest days as a wagon, but with 40 inches of driver headroom, the 43 inches of legroom and combined 52 cubic feet of cargo space with the seats down. The standard multi-function display, Starlink touchscreen communications and entertainment package and rearview camera are all fine perks for Subaru's smallest crossover. But are they worth an extra $4,500 for mileage that's only two miles per gallon better than the all-gas version?<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>EPA combined city and highway mileage:</strong> 33 mpg, 32 mpg all-wheel drive</p>
<p>A luxurious, hybrid version of the Toyota RAV-4 seemed like a great idea at the time. Almost 18 cubic feet of cargo space, 36 inches of legroom in the back, a smartphone charger, LED lighting a remote touchpad to control your information and entertainment options also sounded fairly pleasant. However the NX 300h is fairly fortunate that its mileage leads the class right now, since naysayers have noticed that there isn't a lot of hybrid competition for it in the luxury sector.</p>
<p>“There aren't many hybrids to compete against the NX, but you should still be aware that we weren't fans of the uneven braking feel or the stiffer than normal ride quality,” said Edmunds.com automotive editor Mike Takahashi. “We had stronger negative reactions to Lexus' remote touch infotainment controller. Outside of those issues, it gets high marks for rear seat space, quality interior elements and a wealth of high-tech features.”</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute found that cars and light trucks purchased in 2014 got an average of 25.4 miles to the gallon. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that it set back in 2012, but it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Give crossovers a whole lot of thanks for that. Automakers sold more than 2.5 million of them in the U.S. through July -- with a big assist from fuel prices that are down an average of 90 cents per gallon from this time a year ago. That makes crossovers the single largest class of vehicle ahead of midsize cars (2.1 million sold through July), small cars (1.9 million) pickups (1.4 million) and all non-crossover SUVs combined (970,000).<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9971943699648655' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Crossover sales are up 14% year-to-date over last year, but that doesn't mean every SUV is exactly a lean, green machine. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the six-cylinder, supercharged Volkswagen Toureg Hybrid -- a car that doesn't even rely on its gas-powered engine 100% of the time -- still only manages a scant 21 miles per gallon combined. That's the same mileage as a four-wheel-drive Nissan Pathfinder, which isn't exactly a bastion of fuel economy.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>With help from the EPA's <a href=\"http://www.fueleconomy.gov\" target=\"blank\">FuelEconomy.gov<\u002fa> site, we compiled a list of the most fuel-efficient SUVs currently being sold. Models with limited availability like the BYD e6 or the Toyota RAV4 EV didn't make the list this year but may when they become more widely available in the future. There are hybrid and diesel vehicles on this list, but as we'll make clear, hybrid engines and alternative fuels are no guarantee of fuel efficiency:<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"10 SUVs to Get While Gas Is Cheap","callout":"SUV sales spiked in 2015 as gas prices slid.

Just know that if you decide to go with the all-wheel-drive version, that mileage drops to less than 25 mpg.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"5 Cities Where You Can Both Save or Waste the Most Money on Gas","callout":"Gas stations charge as much as they think they can, but there's not always a good explanation why one station charges a lot more.","authorName":"Jerry Kronenberg","authorId":1278569,"url":"/article/5-cities-where-you-can-both-save-or-waste-the-most-money-on-gas","storyId":13122937,"publishDate":"2015-04-23T12:15:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Apr 23, 2015 8:15 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bakersfield-large_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bakersfield-large.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-d6b51991-f860-41b4-98f7-9f9a67ea3de0\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"These Are the 2015 Auto Models to Drive If You Hate the Earth","callout":"'Green' cars are getting lots of publicity ahead of Earth Day, but here's a look at the year's 'meanest' models — those called the worst for the environment.","authorName":"Jerry Kronenberg","authorId":1278569,"url":"/article/these-are-the-2015-auto-models-to-drive-if-you-hate-the-earth","storyId":13114372,"publishDate":"2015-04-16T12:15:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Apr 16, 2015 8:15 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bugattiveyronlead_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bugattiveyronlead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos"},{"headline":"There's Good News Behind These Car Maintenance Tips: Mainly Stable or Lower Costs","callout":"Slow your roll, car lovers.

It has a reasonable-for-its-class entry price, it's incredibly fuel efficient -- though all-wheel drive drops that to 25 miles per gallon -- and it gives families everything they're looking for. After the popular crossover's 2012 overhaul, it's it added a leather interior, moonroof, Pandora-connected information display, heated seats and rearview windows and navigation system with controls mounted on the steering wheel. Oh, and there's still 70 cubic feet of maximum cargo space. This list surrounds the CR-V with similarly efficient competition, but this vehicle is still the small crossover standard.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text'
