Gridlock is in the air.</a></p>
<p>"Some of the biggest potential changes will require Congressional action," said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher and vice president of Cappex.com, a Chicago-based website that connects students with colleges and financial aid. "Ideas like refinancing of federal and private student loans at lower interest rates and bankruptcy discharge of federal and private loans are unlikely to occur in a Republican-controlled Congress. Even if the Democrats were to gain a majority in the House and Senate, they are unlikely to gain a supermajority, so changes concerning student loans will require persuasion and cooperation." A supermajority is achieved when 60 senators vote to end a filibuster that prevents a bill from coming to a vote.</p>
<p>But the appointment of Rohit Chopra to the Department of Education (ED) may make a difference if he can bolster borrower protections in the current year.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7764334800648979' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Chopra unexpectedly left the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in June, where he was student loan ombudsman and was a vocal critic of for-profit colleges and the companies ED hired to service and collect federal student loans. Seven months later, he's landed at the federal agency that he made the object of pointed criticism. How he will shake up ED--and how much time he has to do that--may be a highlight of the coming year.</p>
<p>Chorpa's job title has not been announced, and he could not be reached for comment. It was not clear whether he was hired as a federal employee or a consultant whose tenure might end before the current administration leaves office. Undersecretary of Education Ted Mitchell acknowledged in a January "Dear Colleagues" letter to ED staffers that Chopra had joined the Department in an undisclosed capacity.</p>
<p>Mitchell stated Chopra would be "working directly with me and the senior leadership in my office in our ongoing work to strengthen our student aid programs. Rohit’s experience in protecting borrowers and his expertise in financial services policy will advance and deepen that work. He will contribute to our current work to improve higher education access, affordability and outcomes through innovation, enhanced protections for students, improved borrower service, and strong accountability for institutions." His focus will be, Mitchell said, analyzing state consumer protections for borrowers, including complaint systems and tuition refund programs and identifying ways to make more data available to stakeholders.</p>

<p>Dash noted that servicing was an area in which Chopra had a lot of experience but added that much of what can be done without new legislation had already been accomplished. The biggest change has been to align the interests of borrowers to servicers. Maintaining that alignment will be equally challenging.</p>
<p>“Loan servicers who collect payments on federal direct student loans are now incentivized to help borrowers avoid default,” said Dash. Direct federal loans replaced FFELP loans, made through the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which was ended in 2010 and are now being paid off by borrowers. “Contracts governing the servicing of older FFELP loans made by private lenders don't necessarily have such incentives, and may include disincentives that discourage servicers from educating borrowers about income-driven repayment plans.” <a href="Department-of-Education-must-get-straight-with-loan-servicers.html">Student loan servicers have been criticized for steering borrowers into payment plans that prolong the loan pay-off and increase fee revenue for the servicer.</a></p>

He also thinks customer scores of loans servicers should be posted online, so the servicers with the worst user rankings could be identified.</p>
<p>Dash compared the current scale of the student loan crisis with the mortgage crisis that began in 2007, where the sheer number of people who borrowed more than they could repay helped crash the market. "Loan servicers should be part of the solution, not part of the problem, but their performance varies greatly," he said.</p>
<p>Proposals to make community college free could conceivably see the light of day in 2016 since it has some bi-partisan support. <a href="student-loans-made-simple--senator-lamar-alexander-breaks-it-down.html">The Obama administration’s plan seems to have taken its cue from one advocated by Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee.</a> Owing to the cost, however, that solution could amount to half a loaf--or nothing at all.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/2016-student-loan-outlook-amid-big-federal-appointment' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Free community college would go a long way toward reducing college costs and the amount of debt students graduate with, since they'd spend less time at more expensive four-year schools."</p>
<p><a href="ed-wants-to-bring-back-year-round-pell-grants.html">Dash cited the Obama administration’s proposal that would let students use Pell Grants to attend school year-round.</a> “Another initiative launching this year is a pilot program that will allow high school students to use Pell Grants to take college courses. Initiatives that are aimed at curbing college costs probably have a chance at winning bipartisan support," Dash said. "Republicans like presidential candidate John Kasich see states taking a leading role on that." Kasich is also current governor of Ohio.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, two-year degrees, at least those not offered by for-profit colleges, can already be had at bargain-basement prices and are unlikely to go lower.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.09433635065279089' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>“Some people would argue that community college tuition is already free for low-income students, through the benefits of the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Federal Pell Grant,” said Kantrowitz. “The key stumbling block on free public college education in all its variations involves how to pay for it. Increasing taxes, through the capital gains on stocks or the Buffet Rule is a non-starter for Republicans.” Part of Obama’s 2011 tax proposal, the Buffet Rule, first floated by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, would apply a 30% minimum tax to people making $1 million or more annually. It was introduced in the Senate as legislation in 2012, receiving 51 votes, but was shot down by a GOP filibuster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile free community college has gotten more expensive than Senator Alexander may have anticipated. "The Obama administration said the plan would cost the federal government an estimated $60 billion over 10 years, in addition to tens of billions of dollars in commitments from the states," said CreditIQ's Liatsis.</p>
<p>”The Republican Congress would need to pass legislation approving funding,” Liatsis added. “State governments would need to act as well. Is this a conversation starter? Definitely. A political possibility? Not any time soon."</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.35150480315884636' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Capex’s Kantrowitz did not expect Chopra’s hire at ED to herald a turf war between the Department and the CFPB. “The CFPB has authority over private student loans and the Department of Education over Federal student loans," he said. "That won’t change.”</p>
<p>Kantrowitz noted that when Chopra was student loan ombudsman at the CFPB, he worked with higher ed stakeholders, including the Department of Education, on projects such as the financial aid shopping sheet. “I expect that the CFPB will promote a new private student loan ombudsman from within, so the CFPB and ED should continue to work closely on student loan issues,” Kantrowitz said. Among them could be a complaint system at the Department of Education that could benefit from Chopra's work on the CFPB's complaint system. A degree of standardization between the two complaint systems could be in the cards.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/2016-student-loan-outlook-amid-big-federal-appointment' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/2016-student-loan-outlook-amid-big-federal-appointment' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Even if the Democrats were to gain a majority in the House and Senate, they are unlikely to gain a supermajority, so changes concerning student loans will require persuasion and cooperation.\" A supermajority is achieved when 60 senators vote to end a filibuster that prevents a bill from coming to a vote.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>But the appointment of Rohit Chopra to the Department of Education (ED) may make a difference if he can bolster borrower protections in the current year.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7764334800648979' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Chopra unexpectedly left the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in June, where he was student loan ombudsman and was a vocal critic of for-profit colleges and the companies ED hired to service and collect federal student loans.

The biggest change has been to align the interests of borrowers to servicers. Maintaining that alignment will be equally challenging.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>“Loan servicers who collect payments on federal direct student loans are now incentivized to help borrowers avoid default,” said Dash. Direct federal loans replaced FFELP loans, made through the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which was ended in 2010 and are now being paid off by borrowers. “Contracts governing the servicing of older FFELP loans made by private lenders don't necessarily have such incentives, and may include disincentives that discourage servicers from educating borrowers about income-driven repayment plans.” <a href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/Department-of-Education-must-get-straight-with-loan-servicers\">Student loan servicers have been criticized for steering borrowers into payment plans that prolong the loan pay-off and increase fee revenue for the servicer.<\u002fa><\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.30416791404860755' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"

consumer loan aggregator, believes ED should make it easier for borrowers to switch servicers. <a href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/are-student-loans-to-blame-for-high-tuition-costs\">\"The compensation structure of the servicers' contracts should be changed,\" he said, \"to put more emphasis on owning up to borrowers and telling them the truth about their options, rather than steering them into a plan that gets them off the phone quickly<\u002fa>.\" He also thinks customer scores of loans servicers should be posted online, so the servicers with the worst user rankings could be identified.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Dash compared the current scale of the student loan crisis with the mortgage crisis that began in 2007, where the sheer number of people who borrowed more than they could repay helped crash the market. \"Loan servicers should be part of the solution, not part of the problem, but their performance varies greatly,\" he said.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Proposals to make community college free could conceivably see the light of day in 2016 since it has some bi-partisan support. <a

Increasing taxes, through the capital gains on stocks or the Buffet Rule is a non-starter for Republicans.” Part of Obama’s 2011 tax proposal, the Buffet Rule, first floated by Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, would apply a 30% minimum tax to people making $1 million or more annually.
