<p>MotorIntelligence notes that crossover sales have eclipsed 3 million year-to-date and grown 2.8% from last year. Meanwhile, standard SUV sales have climbed to 1.1 million, up 9.2% since the same time in 2012. Even <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13285449/1/10-best-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season.html" target="_blank">minivans</a>, however, have witness a nearly 14% decline within the last year as they struggle to get to the 400,000-vehicle mark.</p>
<p>Amid all of this, there's nary a mention of the venerable station wagon. Basically just elongated versions of an automaker's sedan, station wagons started out as modified wood-paneled trucks in the 1930s before eventually shifting to all-steel car bodies in the 1950s. The Ford Country Squire, the Oldsmobile Vista cruiser, the original Chrysler Town &amp; Country and even the Buick Roadmaster held their grip on U.S. families from the 1960s until just around 1984, when Chrysler began producing the first minivans.</p>
<p>With both minivans and sport utility vehicles falling under the “light truck” distinction, they were given leeway with emissions that car-based station wagons weren't and provided automakers the excuse they needed to favor them over station wagons. One could argue that the wagons made by Subaru, Ford and others that eventually became crossovers are still with us, but that argument is made moot by luxury automakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi, who still make true wagons to this day.</p>

<p>Miles per gallon: 23 city, 29 highway, 26 combined</p>
<p>Even Mercedes considers this an SUV, but with that low center of gravity, AMG sport suspension and exhaust and features including a power liftgate, folding rear seats and 43.6 cubic feet of cargo capacity, we tend to agree with the EPA's call here. It isn't the E-Class wagon, but it's a wagon. The folks at Kelly Blue Book were similarly confounded by the GLA, but that didn't make the car any less fun.</p>
<p>“The Mercedes-Benz GLA is one of those vehicles about which you say to yourself,” says Jack R. Nerad, executive editorial director and executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book’s KBB.com. “I don’t know exactly what this thing is, but I know that I like it.” <br >  <br >  Part crossover, part sports sedan and part hot hatch, the GLA is not only a pure blast to drive (particularly in GLA45 AMG form) but also sports one of the most involving interiors in contemporary cardom.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The Forte 5 is more impressive than it looks. In Edmunds testing, the most powerful engine available, a 201-horsepower turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder, hit 60 mph in just 7.0 seconds, which is ridiculous for a non-luxury wagon. Meanwhile, the interior is cushy, the controls are easy to use and the materials aren't skimpy. When Kia offers a vehicle like the Forte with standard MP3 and Sirus-XM in the audio system, audio control and Bluetooth wireless in the steering wheel, a fuel-efficiency monitor, combined 29 mpg fuel efficiency, more than 23 cubic feet of cargo room and a ten-year and 100,000-mile warranty at this price, you give it some serious thought.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>We'll admit, the 75.5 cubic feet of passenger space inside the standard Fiat 500 is a bit tight. The four-door 500L, meanwhile, has a slightly more roomy 123 cubic feet of space to go with its peppy 160-horsepower engine, seven airbags, voice command with Bluetooth, flip and fold rear seats and 33 miles per gallon on the highway. It's a Fiat with more room, if less mileage, which makes it a whole lot easier to swipe at your tablet without elbowing someone in the head.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Starting price:</strong> $19,490</p>
<p>Miles per gallon: 25 city, 34 highway, 29.5 combined</p>
<p>The Subaru Outback was once simply a Subaru Legacy wagon. The Subaru Forester was basically just a very tall version of a wagon in its earliest days. The Crosstrek XV wants to say it's a crossover, but it basically looks like a wagon.</p>
<p>That makes the fuel-sipping stretched Impreza the last true wagon being sold by a company that was basically built on them. When you bump up to the limited edition, the mileage improves to 32.5 miles per gallon combined -- including 38 mpg on the highway -- but any variant will get you the 22.5 cubic feet of cargo space that expands to a whopping 52.5 cubic feet with the seats down.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>6. 2015 Nissan Juke</strong></p>
<p>MSRP: $21,250</p>
<p>Miles per gallon: 28 city, 32 highway, 30 combined</p>
<p>The Juke has been out there for five years, and instead of making its freaky performance crossover with six headlights into a staid bore headed for the rental lots, Nissan opted to go full-tilt weird with it. The grill now has a triangular shape, the parking lights on the top of the fenders now have LED daytime running lights built into them and Nissan has countered the car's “ugly” label with a term of its own: polarizing.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.00240623642154425' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>In the company's view, people once called Eames chairs, the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the original iPod “ugly.” Sometimes, “ugliness” is just design that the middle of the road isn't quite ready for yet. In the Juke's case, there are a whole lot of people who are into keeping the Juke weird. Though Nissan sold fewer than 9,000 Jukes in 2010, that figure rose to 38,184 by the end of last year.</p>
<p>You may call it ugly, but Nissan calls it a pretty decent niche. Sure, the Juke is small and funny looking, but a surprising 36 cubic feet of cargo space and a navigation system, rearview camera, leather interior and an beefed-up speaker system available as upgrades. Not bad perks for a car sporting all of four cylinders in its engine while putting out 188 horsepower.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>We'll note that the two-liter, four-cylinder engine for the front-wheel drive model is the only one that gets anything close to this kind of mileage. The five-cylinder all-wheel-drive upgrade cuts combined mileage to less than 25 miles per gallon, but the base still gets you 43.8 cubic feet of cargo space; 3,500 pounds of towing capacity power driver's; and front-passengers' seats, power moonroof and an audio and communications system with a seven-inch touchscreen.</p>

<p>The Germans just love making a traditional station wagon, and the Golf Sportwagen just continues that love affair. With roomy seating for five, 30.4 cubic feet of cargo capacity with the rear seats up and 66.5 cubic feet of room with the seats flat, this is the family wagon for those who can't bear the thought of a minivan, never bought into SUVs and don't want to spend on Audi or Mercedes wagons. <br >  <br >  The quiet cabin and smattering of Volkswagen tech throw-ins are a nice touch as well, but it's the turbocharged 2.0-liter diesel engine that gets 43 miles per gallon on the highway that helps a budget-conscious family spend a little more on the vacation itself.

<p>Miles per gallon: 120 city, 92 highway, 105 combined</p>
<p>Electric charge range: 93 miles</p>
<p>The box on wheels once sold with the help of dancing hamsters and LMFAO songs received electric upgrade and, for perhaps the first time in Kia history, there are waiting lists for its products. The touchscreen infotainment system and its charge status updates, charging station navigation, climate control and sound system with beat-sensing mood lighting are all secondary concerns -- as is the boasted top speed of 149 miles per hour.</p>
<p>It doesn't have the broad color palate, mix-and-match accent plates and sunroof upgrades still of the standard model, but it's still has the Soul's versatile 60/40 rear seating and 23.7 cubic feet of cargo space (49.5 with the rear seats down) that make it an ideal electric surf shack, bike shuttle or city shopping companion. The ten-year, 100,000-mile Kia warranted doesn't hurt, either.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Meanwhile, standard SUV sales have climbed to 1.1 million, up 9.2% since the same time in 2012. Even <a href=\"http://www.thestreet.com/story/13285449/1/10-best-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season.html\" target=\"_blank\">minivans<\u002fa>, however, have witness a nearly 14% decline within the last year as they struggle to get to the 400,000-vehicle mark.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Amid all of this, there's nary a mention of the venerable station wagon. Basically just elongated versions of an automaker's sedan, station wagons started out as modified wood-paneled trucks in the 1930s before eventually shifting to all-steel car bodies in the 1950s. The Ford Country Squire, the Oldsmobile Vista cruiser, the original Chrysler Town &amp; Country and even the Buick Roadmaster held their grip on U.S. families from the 1960s until just around 1984, when Chrysler began producing the first minivans.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>With both minivans and sport utility vehicles falling under the “light truck” distinction, they were given leeway with emissions that car-based station wagons weren't and provided automakers the excuse they needed to favor them over station wagons. One could argue that the wagons made by Subaru, Ford and others that eventually became crossovers are still with us, but that argument is made moot by luxury automakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi, who still make true wagons to this day.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9997472141939332' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>However, as the Environmental Protection Agency's “wagon” category suggests, a station wagon is often whatever vehicle you perceive it to be.
