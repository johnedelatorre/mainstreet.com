<p>Even with the recent warming of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba, Americans are still technically not allowed to go to Cuba to just sit on the beach. As has been the case for years, Americans must have a purpose for their visit, whether it's educational, cultural or religious.</p>
<p>But by many accounts, the beaches aren't where it's at in Cuba anyway.</p>
<p>"For people who love travel, Cuba is a huge treat in so many different ways. It's not like any other place you've visited," says Peggy Goldman, president of <a href="http://www.friendlyplanet.com/vacation-packages/caribbean/cuba.html"><strong>Friendly Planet Travel</strong></a>, which has been offering tours to the island for the past three and a half years. "You spend 50 minutes on a flight and you end up in a completely different place. It's almost like a time warp. You're in a place that really feels like the 1950s — the cars, the way the buildings look, the way people entertain themselves ... There is a real juxtaposition of time and image.

<p>Revised rules that took effect in January mean tourists can now bring home up to $100 worth of Cuban cigars and rum and another $300 in other souvenir purchases.</p>
<p>Flying to Cuba is going to get easier. <strong>American Airlines</strong> has already announced it will soon begin service from Newark and Houston direct to Havana, says one travel industry insider.</p>
<p>Other media reports have noted that <strong>Orbitz</strong> expects to have flights to Cuba, as well as hotel options, available to the public this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Americans buy tickets on charter flights freely from this country (typically Miami or Los Angeles) to Cuba, says Danilo Bonilla, Cuba program director for <a href="http://www.mtsobek.com/trip/experiencing-cuba"><strong>Mountain Travel Sobek</strong></a>.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.5057414530666721' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>"That is new — the charter flights. Before the changes, only licensed institutions and the travel service providers could do that," says Bonilla, noting that you still must get a travel visa from the Cuban consulate. Tickets for such charter flights typically cost between $500 and $600 round trip, Bonilla says.</p>
<p>Efforts are also underway to establish the banking infrastructure in Cuba necessary to allow Americans to use credit cards there, eliminating a decades-old restriction that made travel particularly challenging and cash heavy for U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Jorge Salas, of <strong>New Paths Expeditions</strong>, says the softened travel regulations allow his company to begin offering the U.S. market the first natural history and cultural expeditions to Cuba via small ship.</p>
<p>"This was not possible before, but the new regulations allow it and we are the first to do it," Salas says. The trips begin taking bookings in April and will include such things as birding excursions led by local naturalists, a visit to a sea turtle breeding center and a tour of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of Guanahacabibes, where there's 170 species of birds.<br >  <br >  <img src="https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-center-of-havana-friendly-planet-travel.jpg" > </p>

<p>"Right now everything is still, in a way, very pure," Goldman says. "The big hotel chains haven't gotten there yet. It's still a very unique place to visit. And soon all of the uniqueness is going to be blended away. There is going to be a flood of money coming into Cuba to develop it."</p>
<p>So what can you expect if you do go?</p>
<p>For one, do not expect American standards of luxury, and don't expect an inexpensive trip.</p>
<p>Cuba is a pricey destination for a variety of reasons, bureaucracy being one, say Goldman and others.</p>
<p>"It's one of the most bureaucratic destinations on the planet, not just in Cuba, but on our side as well," Goldman says. "Also, the Cubans are not stupid, they have a special tariff for Americans. A Canadian probably pays 40% of what Americans pay."</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cuban-vacation-excitement-what-to-anticipate-in-your-sexiest-new-destination' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

But if 800-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets and pillow top mattresses are part of your vacation requirements, you may want to hold off visiting just yet.</p>
<p>"As a traveler, you have to have understand: Don't expect luxury. And don't expect right-away service. It's not like that yet," says Bonilla, whose most recent trip to Cuba was in January. "There are a few hotels that are better hotels. However, don't expect the <strong>Four Seasons</strong> or The <strong>Ritz-Carlton</strong>."</p>
<p>On the plus side, Cuba is extremely safe and family friendly.</p>
<p>Corrine McDermott has taken her family, which includes two young children, to Cuba five times in recent years and will head off on her sixth trip this March.</p>
<p>"Cuba is an excellent place to bring kids, because they adore children," says McDermott, who writes a blog called <a href="http://havebabywilltravel.com"><em>Have Baby Will Travel</em></a>. "We really wanted to know that wherever we went with our daughter, we would be welcome, and that was very much the case with Cuba."</p>
<p>It's a colorful, friendly, artistic country made for walking, travel experts say.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.18296812951776587' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>"Take the time to walk around. Everyone does it. Doesn't matter what kind of neighborhood it is," Bonilla says. "There is no crime in Cuba because the penalties are very strong. You could go to jail for 10 years for pickpocketing."</p>
<p>Here's another piece of advice from those who have been traveling to Cuba for years: Just because the U.S. administration announced a few changes in the rules on travel and trade does not mean you should rush off on an entirely self-guided tour.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cuban-vacation-excitement-what-to-anticipate-in-your-sexiest-new-destination' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Cuba continues to have its challenges for the uninitiated. For instance, just because you reserve a hotel room in Cuba before you visit does not mean that hotel room will actually be available when you arrive.</p>
<p>That there is no way to know if the hotel will be the quality you expecting, either, unless you work with an experienced tour operator, Bonilla says.</p>
<p>For now, guided "people to people" or educational tours, which have been legal since 2011, remain the most hassle-free and in-depth way to visit the country.</p>
<p>"Because of the way tours have been conducted in order to be legal, because you have always had to go for a purpose, specifically to meet Cubans and engage in educational exchanges, you a really get a chance to rub shoulders with people," Goldman says. "You have a program lined up, you visit a senior center, you visit a school. You do all of those things in the context of exploring life in Cuba, so Cubans and Americans can talk to each other."</p>

<p><strong>Old Havana:</strong> This is a no-brainer. The oldest portion of the island's capital city is dominated by picturesque architecture.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5-trinidad-plaza-mayor-bell-tower-of-iglesia-y-convento-de-san-francisco-dreamstime-13215137.jpg" >  <br >  <br >  Trinidad:</strong> A smaller, secondary city in Cuba, Goldman describes it as one of the best-preserved colonial cities in all of Latin America.</p>
<p>"It's a lovely picturesque town ... really reminiscent of what it was like in the Spanish colonial era," she says.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cuban-vacation-excitement-what-to-anticipate-in-your-sexiest-new-destination' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

                            
                            

                            <div class="page-end"></div>
                        </div>

                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">
<p><strong>Playa Ancon:</strong> Very close to Trinidad, McDermott says this community is a like a mini Havana.</p>
<p>"There's great dining and great shopping," McDermott says.</p>
<p><strong>Vinales:</strong> On the western side of the island, the scenic Vinales Valley is a UNESCO World Heritage Site made up of remarkable landscapes; the town is dominated by one-story wooden houses with porches.</p>
<p>Some of the Cuban hotels worth noting include:</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Parque Central:</strong> Located in the heart of Old Havana, this is a classic and beautiful hotel with a fabulous location.</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Saratoga:</strong> Jay Z and Beyonce stayed here on their visit to Old Havana. Enough said.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.2615203759306681' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Other notable properties include the <strong>Melia Havana</strong> and <strong>Melia Cohiba</strong> — both nice, upscale hotels in the island's capital city.</p>
<p>The visit from such high-profile celebrities as Jay Z and Beyonce did something spectacular for Cuba, by Goldman's estimate. Not long afterward, Obama announced it legal for all of us to visit, she notes.</p>
<p>This will be Cuba's year, Goldman says, predicting that things are going to truly start changing for the island. In perhaps one more example of the world arriving at its doorstep, just last week Conan O'Brien announced that he will be broadcasting from the island in early March.</p>
<p>"Soon Cuba is going to become shiny and cleaner. And that odd juxtaposition of the donkey cart and the guy on a bike and a 1955 Chevy Bel Air all on the same road — that is all going to go away. Cuba right now is still in the late 1950s. That Cuba is definitely going to go away," Goldman says.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/cuban-vacation-excitement-what-to-anticipate-in-your-sexiest-new-destination' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Tickets for such charter flights typically cost between $500 and $600 round trip, Bonilla says.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Efforts are also underway to establish the banking infrastructure in Cuba necessary to allow Americans to use credit cards there, eliminating a decades-old restriction that made travel particularly challenging and cash heavy for U.S. citizens.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Jorge Salas, of <strong>New Paths Expeditions<\u002fstrong>, says the softened travel regulations allow his company to begin offering the U.S. market the first natural history and cultural expeditions to Cuba via small ship.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>\"This was not possible before, but the new regulations allow it and we are the first to do it,\" Salas says. The trips begin taking bookings in April and will include such things as birding excursions led by local naturalists, a visit to a sea turtle breeding center and a tour of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of Guanahacabibes, where there's 170 species of birds.<br >  <br >  <img src=\"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/1-center-of-havana-friendly-planet-travel.jpg\" >
