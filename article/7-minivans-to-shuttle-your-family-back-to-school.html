<p>As of the end of July, there were a total of 278,705 minivans sold in the United States, according to MotorIntelligence. That's not only down 13.9% from last year, but it's getting absolutely swarmed by the 2.5 million <a href="10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy.html" target="_blank">crossover SUVs sold during the same span</a>. Though the minivan is faring much better than similarly sized large SUVs (of which 154,000 were sold though July, down 6.8%) from last year, even the archaic, gas-guzzling midsize non-crossover SUV (542,000 sold) is leaving it in the dust.</p>
<p>Subaru alone (322,000 vehicles through June) outsells all minivan sales combined in the U.S. market, and it's just 3.2% of the total U.S. vehicle market. Not surprisingly, however, the minivan market and Subaru have one thing in common: each offers the car-buying public exactly seven options. If you want to count Dodge's Grand Caravan and Chrysler's Town and Country as the same vehicle, the minivan market actually consists of six vehicles.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.0955047786788421' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Other than Chrysler, no other U.S. automaker even touches the minivan anymore. The Chevrolet Venture and Astro? They've been gone for a decade. The Chevrolet Uplander that replaced them? Barely saw the end of 2008. The Ford Aerostar, Windstar and Freestar? HBO was airing new episodes of <em>The Sopranos</em> the last year those minivans were produced.</p>
<p>Yet the minivan has managed to survive on the U.S. market despite what's become a deeply ingrained stigma against it. It's uncool, it's the symbol of parenthood and it isn't terribly exciting. What it is, however, is incredibly good at its job.</p>
<p>“The minivan has had lasting appeal because of its practical functionality,” says Brandy Schaffels, chief editor for auto site AskPatty.com. When it comes to hauling around lots of people and lots of stuff, minivans can be the most practical choice. Unlike most large SUVs, their low and flat floors allow easy access for loading passengers and cargo, and sliding doors make it easy to get lots of people and big objects in and out quickly.”</p>
<p>Schaffels notes that minivans have continued to evolve to meet families' needs, even if parents are reluctant to buy them. From underfloor “stow ‘n go” storage nooks in the Chrysler and Dodge minivans, to convenient moveable seats that easily flip and fold (across the all manufacturers), to the new vacuum in the Honda Odyssey, designers are constantly tinkering with minivan features to make life easier for the people who drive them and to make them overall more likable. The have the SUV's high vantage point, but are big enough to fit seven people in comfort. Also, their low floors make it easy to load cargo and for young children to get in and out of.</p>

I’ve done it in the trunk of my 1996 Honda Accord and on the back seats of many other sedans; SUVs don’t offer the convenient floor space and their seats are usually too high to change a baby on.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, we take a look at the last seven (yes, we'll throw Chrysler a bone here) minivans still being sold new here in the U.S. Take a good look, families, because even these likely won't be around forever.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Ford killed the Mercury brand in 2011, but the Mercury Villager -- basically a Nissan Quest that Ford rebadged as its own -- has been gone since 2002.</p>

Well, it's gone through two redesigns since the death of the Villager and watched sales slide from 46,000 in 2004 to a low of about 8,600 during the recession. Nissan has sold about 7,200 of its minivans through July, but that's down 12% from the same point in 2014. Yet it's stocked with amenities like heated front seats, a dual moonroof, a rear storage well, DVD entertainment system, three-zone climate control, Bluetooth navigation and rear-view and side-view cameras. The Quest has a lot going for it, but it's just struggling to get anyone to notice.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Introducing a minivan into the U.S. market in 2002 was an admittedly bold move for Kia, but its attempt to to give the minivan a makeover since the introduction of the 2015 Sedona last year has been inspired.</p>
<p>Sedona sales peaked at about 61,000 vehicles way back in 2004 before settling in at roughly 7,000 in 2014. However, after making the exterior look a bit meaner, giving the Sedona xenon headlights, LED taillights and accents, Sirius-XM satellite radio, a touchscreen information and entertainment system, Bluetooth, steering-wheel-mounted controls and a backup warning system, sales jumped to 24,000 through July alone. That's still nowhere near what the leading minivans sell, but it's enough improvement to believe that maybe Kia's rebranding of its minivan as a “Multi-Purpose Vehicle” wasn't such a brash idea after all.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>If you're going to play the minivan game in 2015, you have two strategies at your disposal: cram the giant box with tech toys or fill it with people.</p>
<p>Toyota's decided to take the latter route with the Sienna and use an upright folding seat in the second row to squeeze in as many as eight passengers. The entire second row slides up to allow third-row access and the second and third rows can fold away if there's a need for extra storage. That 39 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row can expand to as much as 150 cubic feet with the seats away.</p>
<p>With power sliding doors, keyless entry, power liftgate in the back, second, row climate controls, a sliding center console, panoramic moon roof, backup cameras and Entune entertainment and information system all available, the Sienna is only giving families more to love by raising the stakes on its rival Honda Odyssey. However, they really need to stop calling it a “swagger wagon.” C'mon.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Maximum cargo space: 44 cubic feet</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes buyers <em>want</em> a minivan, but just don't <em>need</em> all the room it provides. The Mazda5 has had their back for years by cramming all of a minivan's features into a a small package with the handling of a car. The Mazda5 still has three rows, but room for only six as the third row shades toward the small side.</p>
<p>The middle row, meanwhile, consists of two captain's chairs with a pop-up table and storage space that goes between them. That said, the Mazda5 also trims out a lot of the more superfluous minivan perks. Its four-cylinder engine manages only 157 horsepower, but gives it incredible gas mileage. The interior doesn't have 100+ cubic feet of cargo space, but the 44 cubic feet it does provide when the rear seat is folded down is still fairly formidable.</p>
<p>“As a smaller version of the typical minivan, the Mazda 5 can only seat six and even then, taller passengers may feel cramped,” says Mark Takahashi, automotive editor for Edmunds.com. “To its credit, it is easier to park and handling response is better than average, but its advantage in terms of fuel economy is rather slim. It also doesn't offer some common conveniences and the engine struggles when fully loaded. Family-minded shoppers should also be wary of its disappointing crash test scores.”<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>A minivan is only as fun or boring as you make it.</p>
<p>In the Odyssey's case, its versatile cabin seats up to eight, with second-row seats that can be configured to fit three child seats. The Odyssey's removable center console offers a useful flip-up trash-bag holder, and there's also a "cool box" beverage cooler to accommodate chilled refreshments. Available features include a blind-spot warning system and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system with a 16-inch screen capable of simultaneously displaying two different program sources.</p>
<p>Best of all, an in-cabin vacuum is an available option for parents who just know that a healthy percentage of that trip's road snacks are going to end up on the floor. It also comes in handy for a vehicle that can carry up to eight people with enough room behind them for a small grill. More importantly, it can carry five family members, collapse the third row and have 93.1 cubic feet for more storage.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Amazingly, Dodge sold as many as 250,000 Grand Caravans as recently as 2002. While the 134,000 it sold last year is nowhere near that mark, rebranding this minivan as a tailgater's dream has definitely helped sales recover from 91,000 in 2009.</p>
<p>Dodge's latest take on the classic minivan includes more than 83 cubic feet of cargo space with the third-row seats down, a flip-back option for that third row that turns it into a lot-facing couch, a Blu Ray/DVD system with second and third-row screens for pre-game entertainment, and USB and aux ports for hooking up both audio and computers. Best of all, the Caravan's available Wi-Fi option not only allows folks with Sunday Ticket to stream other games through laptops, tablets and smartphones, but it makes the minivan a mobile hotspot with a 150-foot radius for all your friends following their fantasy team more closely than the teams they're paying to see.</p>
<p>Oh, and that 3.6-liter engine generates 283 horsepower, which makes it great for towing a boat, quads, a giant smoker or many other things that aren't necessarily kid-related -- though we're sure the kids will love the two-screen Blu-ray and DVD entertainment system that also lets passengers plug in game consoles.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>So what does the Town and Country have that the Grand Caravan doesn't? Swag.</p>
<p>Chrysler really wants you to know that this is the minivan for the moneyed, well-behaved children, and not the glorified zoo animals who ride in a Dodge.

<p>But the Grand Caravan owner does get something his or her hoity-toity Town and Country counterparts don't: the same engine and cargo space and about $8,000 extra dollars to play around with.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

That's not only down 13.9% from last year, but it's getting absolutely swarmed by the 2.5 million <a href=\"https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-with-the-best-fuel-economy\" target=\"_blank\">crossover SUVs sold during the same span<\u002fa>. Though the minivan is faring much better than similarly sized large SUVs (of which 154,000 were sold though July, down 6.8%) from last year, even the archaic, gas-guzzling midsize non-crossover SUV (542,000 sold) is leaving it in the dust.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Subaru alone (322,000 vehicles through June) outsells all minivan sales combined in the U.S. market, and it's just 3.2% of the total U.S. vehicle market. Not surprisingly, however, the minivan market and Subaru have one thing in common: each offers the car-buying public exactly seven options. If you want to count Dodge's Grand Caravan and Chrysler's Town and Country as the same vehicle, the minivan market actually consists of six vehicles.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.0955047786788421' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Other than Chrysler, no other U.S. automaker even touches the minivan anymore. The Chevrolet Venture and Astro? They've been gone for a decade. The Chevrolet Uplander that replaced them? Barely saw the end of 2008. The Ford Aerostar, Windstar and Freestar? HBO was airing new episodes of <em>The Sopranos<\u002fem> the last year those minivans were produced.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Yet the minivan has managed to survive on the U.S. market despite what's become a deeply ingrained stigma against it. It's uncool, it's the symbol of parenthood and it isn't terribly exciting. What it is, however, is incredibly good at its job.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>“The minivan has had lasting appeal because of its practical functionality,” says Brandy Schaffels, chief editor for auto site AskPatty.com. When it comes to hauling around lots of people and lots of stuff, minivans can be the most practical choice. Unlike most large SUVs, their low and flat floors allow easy access for loading passengers and cargo, and sliding doors make it easy to get lots of people and big objects in and out quickly.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Schaffels notes that minivans have continued to evolve to meet families' needs, even if parents are reluctant to buy them. From underfloor “stow ‘n go” storage nooks in the Chrysler and Dodge minivans, to convenient moveable seats that easily flip and fold (across the all manufacturers), to the new vacuum in the Honda Odyssey, designers are constantly tinkering with minivan features to make life easier for the people who drive them and to make them overall more likable. The have the SUV's high vantage point, but are big enough to fit seven people in comfort. Also, their low floors make it easy to load cargo and for young children to get in and out of.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9337855497701527' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>“Honestly, on the simplest level, it’s much easier to change a baby’s diaper on the floor of a minivan than it is on the floor of any SUV I’ve ever driven,” Schaffels says. “And dealing with diaper changes on the go is something that parents often have to deal with. I’ve done it in the trunk of my 1996 Honda Accord and on the back seats of many other sedans; SUVs don’t offer the convenient floor space and their seats are usually too high to change a baby on.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p>With that in mind, we take a look at the last seven (yes, we'll throw Chrysler a bone here) minivans still being sold new here in the U.S. Take a good look, families, because even these likely won't be around forever.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"10 SUVs to Get While Gas Is Cheap","callout":"SUV sales spiked in 2015 as gas prices slid.

However, after making the exterior look a bit meaner, giving the Sedona xenon headlights, LED taillights and accents, Sirius-XM satellite radio, a touchscreen information and entertainment system, Bluetooth, steering-wheel-mounted controls and a backup warning system, sales jumped to 24,000 through July alone. That's still nowhere near what the leading minivans sell, but it's enough improvement to believe that maybe Kia's rebranding of its minivan as a “Multi-Purpose Vehicle” wasn't such a brash idea after all.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/7-minivans-to-shuttle-your-family-back-to-school' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"5 Cities Where You Can Both Save or Waste the Most Money on Gas","callout":"Gas stations charge as much as they think they can, but there's not always a good explanation why one station charges a lot more.","authorName":"Jerry Kronenberg","authorId":1278569,"url":"/article/5-cities-where-you-can-both-save-or-waste-the-most-money-on-gas","storyId":13122937,"publishDate":"2015-04-23T12:15:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Apr 23, 2015 8:15 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bakersfield-large_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bakersfield-large.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-ee16e404-9e0f-4e87-bc86-f8fbbcb2f62f\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"These Are the 2015 Auto Models to Drive If You Hate the Earth","callout":"'Green' cars are getting lots of publicity ahead of Earth Day, but here's a look at the year's 'meanest' models — those called the worst for the environment.","authorName":"Jerry Kronenberg","authorId":1278569,"url":"/article/these-are-the-2015-auto-models-to-drive-if-you-hate-the-earth","storyId":13114372,"publishDate":"2015-04-16T12:15:00Z","publishDateAsString":"Apr 16, 2015 8:15 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bugattiveyronlead_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bugattiveyronlead.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos"},{"headline":"There's Good News Behind These Car Maintenance Tips: Mainly Stable or Lower Costs","callout":"Slow your roll, car lovers.
