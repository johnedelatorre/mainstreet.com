<p>As <a target="blank" data-add-tracking="true" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/career/employment/puny-december-jobs-report-wont-derail-recovery">we have reported</a>, December delivered some pretty grim job numbers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics the economy added <a target="blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">just 74,000 jobs</a> over the month, far fewer than economists had predicted and less than half of November's job growth. Unemployment dropped slightly to 6.7% without much growth in employment, and nearly a third of the unemployed have been out of work for 27 weeks or more.</p>
<p>According to the <a target="blank" href="http://www.epi.org/press/job-openings-job-seekers/">Economic Policy Institute</a> "for more than three out of five job seekers, there simply are no jobs."</p>
<p>In other words, we have a very serious jobs problem.</p>
<p>Where did they all go? After all, not so long ago, America enjoyed high employment and general prosperity. We build more, mine more, grow more and invent more for more people now than we did back then. Innovation hasn't fallen off; in fact most of the smart phone and the entire tablet revolutions have taken place since 2007. So if we're all still here making, buying and consuming things, why can't we put people back to work? Where have all the jobs gone?</p>

<p><strong>Structural Unemployment</strong></p>
<p>The economy today can't create as many jobs as it did before, an issue called structural unemployment. The jobs haven't moved or changed; we just need far fewer workers than we did before. Two major theories compete to explain why this is so: supply and demand side economics.</p>
<p>"Why [unemployment] has remained stubbornly high is I'd say the million dollar question," said University of Chicago economist Allen Sanderson. "And the answers to that question tend to change from the extreme right to the extreme left... You go back to the right wing, and they say that the answer is taxes and regulations that the Obama administration has heaped on the economy. You go back to the left wing, and they say it's that there's not enough aggregate demand out there, so there just aren't enough jobs."</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/where-did-all-jobs-go' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

                    
                    
                    <div class="page-end"></div>

                        <div class="article-page">
                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">
<p>Supply side economics, Sanderson explained, says that businesses struggle with tight regulations, high taxation and an atmosphere of uncertainty, all of which work aggressively discourage hiring. This line of thinking argues, therefore, that to encourage hiring we need to reduce government demands so employers have the freedom and money to hire additional workers.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.745384416421797' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>"Generally households and firms don't like a great deal of uncertainty," Sanderson said. "There've been a lot of changes, whether it's the Affordable Care Act...We're producing a lot of uncertainty here, and I think that's hard for firms and I think that that's hard for households to adjust."</p>
<p>The less confidence a business or consumer has in tomorrow, the less likely he is to spend today. As taxes take away money with which to hire and regulations limit new business models, it becomes increasingly difficult for firms to hire new people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, aggregate demand economics argues that the problem starts at home. Low employment is an issue of aggregate demand. When consumers spend less money, they put less demand on businesses. Those businesses, in turn, need fewer employees, because they have fewer customers to take care of. (It takes fewer people to build 10 widgets than 100, and a business won't hire people to build more than it can sell.)</p>
<p>Employment will remain low, according to demand theory, until businesses have enough customers that they need more employees. Companies aren't charities. Regardless of taxes or regulation, they only hire the people they need, and when demand for their goods or services is low they need fewer people.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.10607963509107865' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Supply siders argue that solving unemployment starts with lower taxes and looser regulation, while demand siders claim that we need to get money into the hands of consumers so businesses will need more employees. Demand side theory is called Keynsian economics and, for example, is essentially the logic behind World War II's effect in ending the Great Depression (wartime spending floods the marketplace with government cash in the form of purchases and employment).</p>
<p>"The problem with that [demand side economics] is where is the money coming from," Sanderson said. "If we want to give a long term unemployment person $200 worth of money, and we pay for that by taking $100 away from you and $100 away from me, it's not obvious that that's much of a gain to the economy."</p>
<p>Still, regardless of whether the driver is supply, demand or, as Sanderson argues, a little bit of both, we're stuck with a problem of structural unemployment. The economy is creating fewer jobs than it did before, and it looks like it will continue to do so for some time to come.</p>

<p>Another contributing factor to unemployment is the shifting labor market. Not every job has evaporated; many of them have moved from shrinking to growing sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>December's jobs report makes that clear. Although some industries showed only a little movement, the service sector alone added over 55,000 jobs. Steadily the U.S. economy is moving in that direction, adding jobs in the services and retail sector and leaving behind people who don't have the training or geography to move with it.</p>
<p>"We're largely a service economy," Sanderson said, "and if I look at the large drivers of GDP it's consumption, investment and government spending. Of those, consumption is the biggest, and within consumption, the service sector is 700 pounds of that 800 pound gorilla."</p>
<p>"And a lot of people say service economy, that's just flipping burgers," he added, "But it's not. There's Microsoft and Google and Amazon.com, that's where the jobs are."</p>
<p>The new jobs are emerging in the service sector, not just stocking shelves at Walmart but managing the warehouses for Amazon, arranging supply lines for Microsoft and working the floor at local retailers. As workers attempt to make the transition from an older, manufacturing based economy these new openings leave many out in the cold, since the skills necessary to weld metal don't translate into selling jackets or working for Apple.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.4374177429007624' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>For teachers out there, education saw one of the biggest dips in December, shedding nearly 15,000 jobs in one month as employment continues to bleed from education and government jobs in general.</p>
<p>Finally, and unfortunately, temporary help is up big, adding more than 40,000 positions in the latest report. The long term impact of that is hard to judge, however, as it may simply be an aberration for the holiday season.</p>
<p><strong>Rising Productivity per Worker</strong></p>
<p>A third long-term issue effecting unemployment is the rising productivity of the modern worker.</p>
<p>"We haven't lost jobs in the sense that I've lost my car keys," Sanderson said. "We've lost jobs, because they've been replaced by machines. There's been a lot of substitution of capital for labor. There's also been a lot of substitution of high human capital for labor."</p>
<p>Companies need fewer workers than they used to. Automation has allowed employers to do more with fewer people; as Sanderson pointed out, although the manufacturing sector continues to shed employees, these days it also produces more than ever before. Productivity is way up in just about every sector of the economy that makes things, and there just isn't the need for as many people to make things as before -- and that's not going to change.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.15547160782202651' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>The companies that are expanding, mostly in the high tech and Internet industries, generally don't need that many employees. Million-dollar websites can operate with a handful of staff members, and even the billion-dollar giant that is Facebook employs fewer than 6,000 people. By contrast, even today Ford directly employs 164,000 to make and sell its automobiles.</p>
<p>It's true that while old industries die, new ones evolve. The old example of buggy whips and lamp lighters held true for a very long time. But something about that dynamic may have changed. The new economy seems to need far fewer employees than the old.</p>
<p>Information products don't need manufacturing: they can be copied and digitally distributed by a server admin and a tech support team. Where once upon a time it took teams of people not only to create something but also to replicate and distribute it, today we only need that team for creation. Replication and distribution, in a digital economy, happen almost instantly.</p>
<p>Although the high-tech industry represents a major area of growth for the economy, as a job creator it's extremely problematic. It's a highly specialized field, demanding years of training and expertise to get even an entry level job and therefore largely excluding anyone who didn't start young. More importantly, technology just doesn't seem to create that many jobs relative to the scale of the economy or the industries its replacing.</p>

At its height, Kodak provided for 120,000.</p>
<p>If we're going to get people working again, our new industries will need to do better than 1,200 to 1 ratios.</p>

There's Microsoft and Google and Amazon.com, that's where the jobs are.\"<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The new jobs are emerging in the service sector, not just stocking shelves at Walmart but managing the warehouses for Amazon, arranging supply lines for Microsoft and working the floor at local retailers. As workers attempt to make the transition from an older, manufacturing based economy these new openings leave many out in the cold, since the skills necessary to weld metal don't translate into selling jackets or working for Apple.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.4374177429007624' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>For teachers out there, education saw one of the biggest dips in December, shedding nearly 15,000 jobs in one month as employment continues to bleed from education and government jobs in general.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Finally, and unfortunately, temporary help is up big, adding more than 40,000 positions in the latest report. The long term impact of that is hard to judge, however, as it may simply be an aberration for the holiday season.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><strong>Rising Productivity per Worker<\u002fstrong><\u002fp>\r\n<p>A third long-term issue effecting unemployment is the rising productivity of the modern worker.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>\"We haven't lost jobs in the sense that I've lost my car keys,\" Sanderson said. \"We've lost jobs, because they've been replaced by machines. There's been a lot of substitution of capital for labor. There's also been a lot of substitution of high human capital for labor.\"<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Companies need fewer workers than they used to. Automation has allowed employers to do more with fewer people; as Sanderson pointed out, although the manufacturing sector continues to shed employees, these days it also produces more than ever before. Productivity is way up in just about every sector of the economy that makes things, and there just isn't the need for as many people to make things as before -- and that's not going to change.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.15547160782202651' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>The companies that are expanding, mostly in the high tech and Internet industries, generally don't need that many employees. Million-dollar websites can operate with a handful of staff members, and even the billion-dollar giant that is Facebook employs fewer than 6,000 people. By contrast, even today Ford directly employs 164,000 to make and sell its automobiles.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>It's true that while old industries die, new ones evolve. The old example of buggy whips and lamp lighters held true for a very long time. But something about that dynamic may have changed. The new economy seems to need far fewer employees than the old.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Information products don't need manufacturing: they can be copied and digitally distributed by a server admin and a tech support team. Where once upon a time it took teams of people not only to create something but also to replicate and distribute it, today we only need that team for creation. Replication and distribution, in a digital economy, happen almost instantly.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Although the high-tech industry represents a major area of growth for the economy, as a job creator it's extremely problematic. It's a highly specialized field, demanding years of training and expertise to get even an entry level job and therefore largely excluding anyone who didn't start young. More importantly, technology just doesn't seem to create that many jobs relative to the scale of the economy or the industries its replacing.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7049119505472248' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Pinterest may have replaced Kodak, but it did so with just about 100 employees.
