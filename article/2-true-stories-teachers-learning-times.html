Facing mandatory furloughs, stress and <a target="_self" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/moneyinvesting/news/school-closed-recession-hawaii-yes">budget constraints</a>, the teachers who truly care about reaching their students have to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/%C2%BFhttp://www.mainstreet.com/article/family/kids/spread-4-day-school-week">make do with decidedly fewer resources</a>. Closely watched budgets, limited staff and cash-strapped parents and communities have worsened the problem.</p>
<p>But to prove the recession hasn’t left every teacher behind, MainStreet reached out to two instructors who embody innovative American teaching. Each devised her own cutting-edge curriculum to meet students’ unique learning needs, with little to no support. There is the counselor who turned her cell phone into a classroom, and the Twitter aficionado whose 9th- and 10th-graders have connected with thousands of other students and teachers vitrually.</p>
<p>Each story is proof that intelligent life still exists in our schools, and their methods should inspire other instructors to think beyond the four walls of the school building.</p>
<p><strong>Vicki Davis’s Flat Classroom</strong></p>
<p>In the small farming community of Camilla, Ga., <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coolcatteacher.com/">Vicki Davis’s</a> students are examining the global impact of social issues, byte-by-byte.  ¿¿As part of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flatclassroomproject.org/">Flat Classroom Project</a>, an award-winning Web initiative that Davis co-founded with her colleague Julie Lindsay and is based on the bestselling book <em>The World Is Flat</em> by Thomas Friedman, students connect with peers and teachers in a global classroom to consider how technology can be used to address real world issues.</p>

                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">Despite a tuition increase, enrollment at Westwood Schools (where Davis teaches) is up, and Friedman himself even included Davis’s Flat Classroom project in the third edition of his book. Of course, success hasn’t come without its share of recession-era hurdles.</p>
<p>Once the recession hit, Davis says, to ensure that all of the school’s tech purchases were as affordable as possible Westwood formed an advisory board specifically to keep an eye on her department. ¿¿“It wasn’t that they didn’t trust me,” Davis says of the administration’s move, “but they wanted to get second and third person opinions on how much money was being spent.”</p>
<p>But what the board discovered couldn’t have come as more of a shock: they decided that Davis was actually under-utilizing her funds by taking advantage of free, open-source applications available online.</p>
<p>“Schools are not being creative and are blocking everything,” says Davis, referring to the Children’s Internet Protection Act, which requires that K-12 schools use Internet filters to block students from accessing so-called harmful content. “They are prohibiting innovation and think you have to pay money for [resources], but anything the school is paying for has a free and open-source alternative.”</p>

<p>“It may be on Twitter, a lot are on Facebook, but build that network and you’ll get better information because it’s personal to you and you can get what you’re interested in. The teachers who are doing it the best with the least amount of money are getting their ideas from their network,” she says.</p>

<p>“I would go home and create [a learning site], and then return to the school and explain why it was useful,” she says. Nearly every time the school happily complied with her request to unblock the site.</p>
<p>Today Davis continues to teach her ninth- and 10th-grade students the ins and outs of global collaboration, tech safety and digital citizenship, and encourages other teachers to get with the program and find progressive ways to work around their schools’ digital “walled gardens”.</p>

<p><strong>Willyn Webb: Generation Text</strong></p>
<p>Ask most teachers how they feel about texting in the classroom and they’ll shoot you a dirty look perhaps followed by an earful about how disruptive smartphones can be in the classroom. But for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.willynwebb.com/">Willyn Webb</a>, a licensed counselor and English teacher in the poverty-stricken area of Delta County, Co., just outside Aspen, the enervating habit has provided an unexpected learning tool.</p>
<p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/2-true-stories-teachers-learning-times' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

                            
                            

                            <div class="page-end"></div>
                        </div>
                    
                        <div class="article-page">
                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">“For me, it happened as a result of having close relationships with my students,” the co-author of four instructional guidebooks, including Teaching Generation Text, says. “[Texting] is the way they communicate, and it kind of came naturally. One day, I forgot my stopwatch to time a speech and a student handed me his phone, which was nicer than mine. I said, ‘Everybody take out your phone,’ and soon attendance at my events started to skyrocket. What I realized was [students] were more likely to attend when they were able to use their phone.”</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.2740339682294656' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>It also dawned on Webb that her newfound learning tool cost next to nothing to use. Thanks to free group-texting services like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo-text.me%2F&amp;rct=j&amp;q=textme&amp;ei=cllgTqqfM4WCgAfch9WiAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjbiMer-nhHP6OkpBxs-klJSNcbQ&amp;sig2=axjVwawkuqayqWFRRiuIxA&amp;cad=rja">TextMe</a>, Webb did her homework and decided to use programs like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.polleverywhere.com/">PollEverywhere</a> to set up questions on various assignments, and <a target="_blank" href="http://wiffiti.com/">Wiffiti</a>, a service that poses a question and allows students to anonymously respond and collaborate on lessons.</p>
<p>“Our economy has been so hard, you just can’t enhance your lessons with fun things like you used to be able to do because there’s no budget,” Webb says. “It only makes good sense to use the tools you already have. Ninety-four percent of American households have a cell phone, so I encourage my students to group use or borrow one from a family member or friend. Besides, a lot of tech sharing needs to go on in these budget-strapped times.”</p>
<p>For a recent poetry assignment, Webb had students go home and observe their surroundings. But rather than simply write about what they saw and bring it in to share the next day in class, Webb had her students call Google Voice to express what they saw, heard, thought and felt.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.4288895508245315' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>“I found the students were much more likely to do that than try to write it down,” Webb recalls, because “that’s the way they’re used to communicating.”</p>
<p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/2-true-stories-teachers-learning-times' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

                            
                            

                            <div class="page-end"></div>
                        </div>

                            <div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body">And while many teachers surely view texting in class suspiciously, as it could be used to cheat on tests, Webb found that integrating the practice into homework and daily lessons made her classes run more smoothly and that “with boundaries in place, they’re not a problem, just part of managing the classroom.” Before a test, for example, students are asked to place their phones in a basket in front of the teacher’s desk.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, Webb has also noticed an uptick in communication with students and even parents on a personal level.</p>
<p>“As a school counselor, if I knew a student had a job interview or pregnancy test it was easy for me to text and ask how it went. It was a great way to make those connections and has increased the home-school connection in that I communicate more with students’ families, some of whom don’t even have a landline.”</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.38955863299145577' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>In a school where the computers are woefully out of date and students have no access to the Web or other learning resources at home, the cellphones have effectively taken the place of the internet, where students can cooperatively learn with one another, access a huge network of experts through social networking sites like Twitter and remind their parents about big events like Parent Night.</p>
<p>“Parents love not getting phone calls,” Webb notes. “They can text in their comments instead.”</p>

instructional guidebooks, including Teaching Generation Text, says. “[Texting] is the way they communicate, and it kind of came naturally. One day, I forgot my stopwatch to time a speech and a student handed me his phone, which was nicer than mine. I said, ‘Everybody take out your phone,’ and soon attendance at my events started to skyrocket. What I realized was [students] were more likely to attend when they were able to use their phone.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.2740339682294656' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>It also dawned on Webb that her newfound learning tool cost next to nothing to use.

Ninety-four percent of American households have a cell phone, so I encourage my students to group use or borrow one from a family member or friend. Besides, a lot of tech sharing needs to go on in these budget-strapped times.”<\u002fp>\r\n<p>For a recent poetry assignment, Webb had students go home and observe their surroundings.
