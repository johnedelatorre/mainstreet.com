<p><a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13434600/1/2016-super-bowl-commercial-preview-these-5-brands-want-your-money-most.html" target="_blank">Super Bowl 50</a> is being played in the San Francisco 49ers' home at Levi's Stadium, a $1.3 billion facility that -- on paper -- was built with just $114 million in public funding. However, the Santa Clara Stadium Authority -- the public entity charged with paying off stadium costs through stadium revenue -- is on the hook for <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/Levi-s-Stadium-The-1-3-billion-bet-5687409.php">$933 million</a>. Technically, that isn't “public funding, because it doesn't require taxpayer money...yet. However, it's a big gamble on the stadium's ability to pay its own debts.</p>
<p>Still, it's a better deal than taxpayers in most NFL towns get. Since 1997, NFL teams have built 18 stadiums and massively renovated two others (Chicago's Soldier Field and Green Bay's Lambeau Field). Each of those projects cost an average of $525 million, with taxpayers on the hook for 56% of it. That history is marked with some terrible deals, including Cincinnati's Hamilton County bearing $424.8 million of the $449.8 million costs of Paul Brown Stadium in 2000 that not only bankrupted certain county programs but didn't factor in the upgrades the Cincinnati Bengals would ask for as the stadium aged.</p>

Nor did taxpayers in Baltimore, who took on 90% of the $226 million cost of M&amp;T Bank Stadium to lure the Browns out of Cleveland and house the Ravens back in 1998. Cleveland, for its part, paid 74% of the $271 million cost of the new Browns' stadium in 1999 without even a prayer of landing the Super Bowl. Yet, somehow, most of those taxpayers got off lightly compared to their counterparts in cities that did land Super Bowls.</p>

<p>Only one combination of city and state has ever paid as much or more than what Minneapolis and Minnesota paid for the home of the 2018 Super Bowl, and they appear later on this list.</p>
<p>However, Minneapolis and Minnesota didn't pay that much just to host their first Super Bowl since 1992. They did so, because after half the Vikings spent more than half a century feeling settled in this northern tundra, their owner threatened to move the team to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Vikings owner Zygi Wilf saw the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome's roof collapse in 2010, forcing games to be moved off site, and watched as competing L.A. stadium plans sought a team. In a panic, Minnesota proposed a new stadium on the Metrodome site that the state would pay for through “charitable gambling.” Though the plan was approved in 2012, the funding portion newer worked out and led to a tax on cigarette inventory instead. Oh, and Minneapolis, meanwhile, will end up paying $678 million over its 30-year payment plan once interest, operations and construction costs are factored into its portion.</p>

<p>The good news is that this stadium has landed Glendale two Super Bowls since it opened in 2006? The bad news? They didn't make a dime for a city that already dug deep for a building.</p>
<p>Within the last decade, Glendale has spent $308 million on a stadium for the Arizona Cardinals, it entered a 15-year, $225 million arena management contract with the Arizona Coyotes, and it paid millions more for a spring training facility for baseball's White Sox and Dodgers. It not only didn't factor in an economic downturn in the middle of all that, but Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12176404/glendale-mayor-not-thankful-host-super-bowl/">told ESPN Magazine</a> his city lost $1 million on the Super Bowl in 2008, and “I totally believe we will lose money" on last year's Super Bowl as well. That's translated into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/26/sports/football/albatross-of-debt-weighs-on-super-bowl-city.html?_r=1">a whole lot of debt</a> for Glendale, which has just about had it with professional sports at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stadium:</strong> AT&amp;T Stadium</p>
<p><strong>Stadium cost:</strong>$1.2 billion</p>
<p><strong>Initial cost to taxpayers:</strong> $444 million</p>
<p><strong>Percent of cost paid with public money:</strong> 37%</p>
<p>This is the third largest amount of public money ever paid for an NFL stadium. However, this is one of the few places where covering 37% of the cost is considered a bargain.</p>
<p>Arlington voters approved a 0.5% increase of the city's sales tax, a 2% hike in the hotel occupancy tax and a 5% boost in car rental tax to cover its bonds. Things looked a bit shaky when it finally landed Super Bowl XLV in 2010 and came up 1,200 seats short. The Cowboys had to offer triple refunds for disgruntled ticketholders and, eventually, were lumped into a $5 million class-action suit against the NFL and owner Jerry Jones. Getting sued by season ticketholders a year into your stadium's existence, but booking your stadium with enough events that the public's $444 million investment is on track to be paid off early, goes a long way toward getting into the taxpayer's good graces.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-cities-that-shelled-out-big-time-for-their-super-bowl' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>It's now wonder this town wouldn't let Deflategate go.</p>
<p>Despite allowing the then-undefeated New England Patriots to come into town for the Super Bowl in 2012, only to leave humbled by the New York Giants, Indianapolis and Indiana paid more than any other NFL host city and state for the privilege.</p>
<p>That $619.5 million is more than the total cost of all but three stadiums used by NFL teams in 2015: MetLife ($1.6 billion), AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas ($1.2 billion) and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara ($1.3 billion). That doesn't count the millions in debt Indianapolis still owes on the long-imploded RCA Dome, which it will be paying off until 2021. The 2012 Super Bowl and the 2010, 2015 and 2021 NCAA Men's Final Four are nice consolation prizes, but they aren't doing much to dig Indianapolis out from under its stadium debt.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-cities-that-shelled-out-big-time-for-their-super-bowl' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>Percent of cost paid with public money:</strong> 100%</p>
<p>No, that isn't the most public money that's ever been paid for a stadium, but that's the only time in 20 years that a team's owners haven't been on the hook for any of it.</p>
<p>To be fair, it isn't exactly as if the Glazer family of owners are paupers. After opening the stadium in 1998, the Glazers were so pleased with their savings that they went out and bought a roughly 90% stake in one of the world's most recognized soccer clubs -- Manchester United. They've since hosted two Super Bowls -- in 2001 and 2009 -- but spend much of their post-recession seasons blacking out broadcasts of Buccaneers home game and cycling through coaches. Their team hasn't had a winning season since 2009 and hasn't made the playoffs since 2007.</p>
<p>Oh, and that stadium is about two years shy of turning 20 years old, which was around the age the Georgia Dome was when the Buccaneers' division rival Atlanta Falcons and owner Arthur Blank decided they just had to have a new stadium. With $240 million in public funding (which will add up to more than $600 million when bonds are paid off), the Falcons' new Mercedes-Benz Stadium is scheduled to open in 2017. Let's see if recession-rocked Tampa can get the Glazers to budge off of $0 the next time they go shopping for a stadium.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-cities-that-shelled-out-big-time-for-their-super-bowl' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-cities-that-shelled-out-big-time-for-their-super-bowl' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>
