Thanks to a huge win on Tuesday night, the party has taken charge of the Senate and increased its already comfortable majority in the House of Representatives. Much, if not all, of the legislative agenda over the next two years will be set from the offices of Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Sen Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). If the past, as well as several campaign slogans, are any guide that means one thing: <a href="can-obamacare-be-mended.html" target="_blank">repealing Obamacare</a>.<br >  <br >  Now, <a href="affordable-care-act-rate-shock.html" target="_blank">a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act simply isn't going to happen</a>. Any law the new Congress passes has to clear Obama's desk, and it's inconceivable that he would sign legislation banishing his namesake achievement. That doesn't mean that the law's opponents are without options, however. <a href="ted-cruz-needs-stop-getting-174000-read-dr-seuss-senate-1.html" target="_blank">Legislators like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) have suggested</a> that one way to get around the Presidential veto will be to simply repeal the law's provisions "one at a time."<br >  <br >  <strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="ted-cruz-needs-stop-getting-174000-read-dr-seuss-senate-1.html" target="_blank">Ted Cruz Needs to Stop Getting $174,000 to Read Dr. Seuss in the Senate</a><br >  <br >  Some of these ideas might even manage to find support from Democrats. While no one outside of Capitol Hill knows precisely what the new majority has in mind, here are a few possible targets in the ACA and how their repeal might impact your health insurance.<br >  <br >  <strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="midterm-elections-reflect-americans-growing-feeling-of-isolation.html" target="_blank">Midterm Elections Reflect Americans' Growing Feeling of Isolation<br > <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-republicans-are-in-charge-of-congress-whats-next-for-obamacare' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

If you want to buy a coverage without mental health protection, they argue, you should be free to do so and save some money.<br >  <br >  This, Democrats generally respond, is like saying <a href="airbag-recall-and-seat-belt-safety-are-you-driving-in-danger.html" target="_blank">cars should be free to come without seat belts</a>. We put in minimum <a href="cars-can-save-you-hundreds-dollars-year-gas.html" target="_blank">consumer standards</a> to prevent a race to the bottom and ensure that everyone has access to some basic features, whether they're well off or not.<br >  <br >  Republicans may well have their shot at stripping consumer standards out of the health insurance marketplace, or at least the chance to add "copper" plans to the marketplace's platinum through bronze levels. Where the current-minimum bronze plans pay for 60% of a person's medical bills, copper plans would be closer to standard catastrophic coverage and pay at most 50%.<br >  <br >  Either of these measures, while potentially effective cost saving measures, could mean very real suffering. As far as copper plans go, they've been called "a false sense of affordability" by <a href="http://kaiserhealthnews.org/news/michelle-andrews-questions-about-copper-plans/" target="_blank">experts </a>in the field who point out that paying half of your own medical bills can get ruinously expensive. The maximum deductible would probably have to go up to about $9,000 for these plans, enough to ruin someone without much savings. "If you ever have to use the plan," said Sabrina Corlette, project director at Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms in an interview with the Kaiser Foundation, "you won't be able to afford it."<br >  <br >  As for stripping out the minimum standards, the thing about health insurance is that it's meaningless if your policy doesn't cover your actual condition. Eliminating coverage for issues like mental health and physical therapy would ensure an entire cohort of people who are technically insured but functionally abandoned because they couldn't afford a higher tier plan. Anyone on a silver or bronze plan, about 85% of the marketplace, could see a very real reduction in their policy benefits if this actually passed.<br >  <br >  <strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="brosurance-tries-sell-obamacare-will-it-work-0.html" target="_blank">'Brosurance' Tries to Sell Obamacare - But Will It Work?<br > <br > <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-republicans-are-in-charge-of-congress-whats-next-for-obamacare' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

The risk corridors act as a safety net for insurers who get too many sick people on their plan. If the company takes a big loss on patients that it would have turned away pre-ACA, the government reimburses a portion of that loss. Republicans <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/burwell-hhs-will-come-to-congress-if-insurance-risk-corridors-need-help/article/2554613" target="_blank">oppose this provision</a> fiercely, arguing against it on the grounds of fiscal responsibility.<br >  <br >  Rhetoric aside, though, risk corridors are in fact either budget neutral or even <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/finance/197367-cbo-now-says-obamacare-risk-corridors-help-deficit" target="_blank">slightly profitable</a> because the door swings both ways. Just as the government agrees to indemnify insurance companies against heavy losses for mandated patients, the insurance companies have to kick back some money from exceptionally profitable years.<br >  <br >  Eliminating the risk corridors would mean less, possibly far less, choice on the <a href="everything-you-need-know-about-obamacare-state-exchanges.html" target="_blank">exchange marketplaces</a>. This would get rid of their safety net. Insurance companies don't have to participate in the ACA exchanges, and if the specter of big losses was put back in the picture, they could very well shy away leading to fewer plans available for everyone.

The IPAB <a href="take-care-tax-impact-obamacare-everyday-americans.html" target="_blank">has the power to set new standards for Medicare payments</a>. It was created as a cost saving measure, a board that could set lower price points as a way of reining in spending. Many critics have accused the program of rationing health care, presumably confusing the difference between limiting how much Medicare will spend on a procedure vs. how much Medicare will spend on a patient.<br >  <br >  The health care industry, unsurprisingly, opposes it because theirs are the bills that the IPAB would chop, and Medicare already only pays about <a href="http://www.aha.org/research/policy/finfactsheets.shtml" target="_blank">86 cents</a> on the dollar.<br >  <br >  Either way the point has been moot. The advisory board is supposed to meet when Medicare spending exceeds ACA targets. Not only has that not happened, but thanks to the surprisingly slow growth in medical expenses, it's not looking likely any time soon. In fact, the 15-member board hasn't even been staffed yet.<br >  <br >  What would happen if it were eliminated? Probably not much. It's possible that this will come up since the Death Panel slogan proved remarkably effective as a piece of political theater and whether Democrats would go along with it is difficult to predict. Some Democrats might vote to eliminate the IPAB just to avoid an ugly roll call. On the other hand, although the board hasn't been important yet it might become so in the future. Obama might push back on this out of long term thinking, but in the here and now, no one would really notice if it were gone. <br >  <br >  <em>--Written for MainStreet by Eric Reed, a freelance journalist who writes frequently on the subjects of career and travel.

The IPAB <a href=\"http://www.mainstreet.com/article/take-care-tax-impact-obamacare-everyday-americans\" target=\"_blank\">has the power to set new standards for Medicare payments<\u002fa>. It was created as a cost saving measure, a board that could set lower price points as a way of reining in spending. Many critics have accused the program of rationing health care, presumably confusing the difference between limiting how much Medicare will spend on a procedure vs. how much Medicare will spend on a patient.<br >  <br >  The health care industry, unsurprisingly, opposes it because theirs are the bills that the IPAB would chop, and Medicare already only pays about <a href=\"http://www.aha.org/research/policy/finfactsheets.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">86 cents<\u002fa> on the dollar.<br >  <br >  Either way the point has been moot. The advisory board is supposed to meet when Medicare spending exceeds ACA targets. Not only has that not happened, but thanks to the surprisingly slow growth in medical expenses, it's not looking likely any time soon. In fact, the 15-member board hasn't even been staffed yet.<br >  <br >  What would happen if it were eliminated? Probably not much. It's possible that this will come up since the Death Panel slogan proved remarkably effective as a piece of political theater and whether Democrats would go along with it is difficult to predict. Some Democrats might vote to eliminate the IPAB just to avoid an ugly roll call. On the other hand, although the board hasn't been important yet it might become so in the future. Obama might push back on this out of long term thinking, but in the here and now, no one would really notice if it were gone. <br >  <br >  <em>--Written for MainStreet by Eric Reed, a freelance journalist who writes frequently on the subjects of career and travel.
