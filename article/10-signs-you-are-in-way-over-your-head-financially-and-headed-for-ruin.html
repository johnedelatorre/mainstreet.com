<p>Consumers are still saving too little despite watching their lifestyles change during the recession and having only meager savings for emergencies while nearly one in four people would run out of money in 30 days, according to a NeighborWorks America survey, the Washington, D.C.-based trainer of community development and affordable housing professionals.</p>

<p>This lack of savings means millions of adults are faced with minimal options such as obtaining high-cost loans such as <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/payday-loans-create-more-problems-borrowers" target="blank" data-add-tracking="true">payday or title loans if an emergency occurs</a>.</p>
The survey also found that 40% of consumers say that their cash reserves would last only for three months and 28% expect their emergency fund to hold them over for a year.

<p>Consumer spending can easily wind up being bad debt, which is debt that is used for the consumption of goods with little to no long-term value or goods with diminishing value, said Jason Ayala, a private wealth advisor in Phoenix, Ariz. for Ameriprise, the financial services company.</p>
<p>“An example of <a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/how-to-tell-if-its-good-debt-or-bad" target="blank" data-add-tracking="true">bad debt</a> is carrying credit card debt that was used to subsidize a standard of living that exceeds your income,” he said. “If used appropriately, debt can be a very powerful and beneficial tool – if not it can derail even the best laid financial plans.”</p>

<p>If you are spending more than 28% of your gross salary paying rent or your mortgage that hampers your ability to maintain a moderate standard of living. Some lenders approved mortgages for homeowners to borrow up to 35% of their income during the past decade, but experts advise against spending that close to the threshold. Consider refinancing your mortgage, obtaining a roommate or at least cutting back on other bills or expenses. The 28% mark is a good rule of thumb, but it may vary depending on where and how you live, said Gallegos.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/why-are-americans-so-addicted-to-debilitating-credit-card-addiction" target="blank" data-add-tracking="true">Being able to maintain your current lifestyle without using your credit cards is a good sign</a>. In July, total consumer revolving debt, which includes credit card debt, rose by 7.4% from June.</p>
<p>“This is a time when consumers can and should be saving more of their personal income compared to driving up debt," said Gallegos.</p>
<p>Consumers should aim to save 10% of their income.</p>
<p>Living within your means on a daily basis and using credit cards only in real emergencies is the best option.</p>
<p>“Paying down credit card debt is one of the best investments you could ever make since the effective rate of return easily can approach 20%,” he said. “In addition, having no credit card debt is in itself a financial cushion. It will require strict discipline, belt-tightening and a revision of your goals.”</p>
