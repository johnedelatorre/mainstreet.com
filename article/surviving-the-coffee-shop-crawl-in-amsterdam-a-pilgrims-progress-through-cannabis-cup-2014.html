<p>There was, truth be told, nothing else going on. Festival organizers at <em>High Times</em> seemed incapable, as a frustrated former sponsor who chose to remain nameless told <em>MainStreet</em>, "of doing anything more than showing their faces in one of the newest coffee shops for hours where they would be seen." Most other attendees at this level (here for professional interactions, even if they did not participate in the Expo) had similarly harsh, if not off the record, comments to make all week.</p>
<p>All previously scheduled lectures were summarily cancelled on Wednesday and attendees showed up to a "newly organized" event meeting place (a cafeteria style restaurant around the corner from the Melkweg) where everyone was informed that the crawl in fact was the only event of the day.</p>

<p>Along the way, there were, as with any great if not transcendental journeys (from the Shire to Smaug and back again or just to the next coffee shop on the list) fellow travelers who tagged along for a stop or two and talk shop.</p>
<p>This was very much therefore the tenor of the day as <em>MainStreet</em> braved the Cannabis Cup 2014 coffee shop crawl as a call of duty and talked to people along the way.</p>

<p>Attendees griped that <em>High Times</em> was incapable of telling them whether "rescheduling" meant that the magazine conference did not get the license, that the venue was "moved" or that the organizers just screwed up. One American grower reported his partner and he spent more than $25,000 (funds which may be partially refunded by <em>High Times</em>) only to miss the Expo and a centralized place to do business that was more professional and suited for the same than the city's crowded coffee shops. Particularly ones when the coffee shop crawl was also in process.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/surviving-the-coffee-shop-crawl-in-amsterdam-a-pilgrims-progress-through-cannabis-cup-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Many were furious at <em>High Times</em> in particular for apparently not only taking the new city regulations less than seriously but starting to organize for the event very late in the game (by some reports less than five weeks out from the November start date). That said, all are mindful of the publication's power within the industry to want to make these statements off the record and anonymously.</p>
<p>Technically, the event was supposed to be conducted on Thursday and was, if you count the "crawl" which consists of different private establishments that are situated within obvious "rings" of the harbor city that is Amsterdam. Otherwise, nothing else went on. In reality, this is an excuse to channel more business into private coffee shops (if not the seed companies behind all of this who are the real power players in the game here) and which have grown markedly less generous this year now that they do not have to compete with mounds of free "samples" coming out of a centralized distribution point like the Melkweg.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/surviving-the-coffee-shop-crawl-in-amsterdam-a-pilgrims-progress-through-cannabis-cup-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The most immediate impact for a great many attendees? No "free" samples, although this policy varied widely and with what kind of event pass one had.</p>
<p>A "VIP" member of the press, particularly when accompanied by several other interesting participants, is still good for soliciting free samples (and from more than one location no matter how much individual coffee shops sometimes claimed to be the only ones giving away the same).</p>
<p>The <em>MainStreet</em> motley crew started the day at noon at mission central and was conveniently guided by a local who knew the geography well. By 5 p.m., participants collectively (three people) had easily collected about 5 grams of pot and hash samples of all kinds in sum. Minus what was consumed along the way, the party might have had 2 grams left each.</p>
<p>If it sounds like "trick or treat" for those over 18, well, that might be pretty close.</p>
<p>Those not so lucky and faced with the prospect of "having" to judge all festival entries spent up to $600 to buy the same kind of experience (or so went the urban legend circulated on Wednesday among pot shops themselves). Nobody in the <em><a href="medical-marijuana-saves-lives-study-reports.html">MainStreet test group</a></em> could understand this rumor, but we discussed it as we scooped up our next freebie and moved on. Ari, a 25-year-old dancer from Spain who is paying the bills by working in another coffee shop while she makes herself known to the city's artistic elite, cannot figure out the math.<br > <br >  "If I had to pay, darling," she says in hopelessly dramatic Spanish thisped English, "I would have been disappointed." As it is, she looks over her stash (which includes the obligatory bags, T-shirts and other non-cannabis products she also obtained during this process) and grins. "I had a great day and learned alot," she says. "I am going to talk to my manager about some of the ideas I saw today."</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/surviving-the-coffee-shop-crawl-in-amsterdam-a-pilgrims-progress-through-cannabis-cup-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>
