<p>Reliability isn't some marketing term. It matters. It's the empirical measure of how often an automobile model breaks down, its frequent problems and how much all of that is going to cost you in time and repairs. For every driver who relies on a car to get to work, move family around and otherwise travel great distances, reliability is key.</p>
<p>Car repair data site <strong>CarMD</strong> just released its <em>Vehicle Health Index</em> reliability ratings and ranked the vehicles with the least combined “check engine” repairs and costs. It culled repair data from 40,400 specific repairs performed on model year 2004 to 2014 vehicles from Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30 of this year.</p>
<p>CarMD ranked the Top 100 vehicles overall, top vehicles by category and the most common repairs by make. While we realize the inherent value of the vehicle list, it seemed somewhat less valuable to feature a Top 10 that included four <strong>Toyota</strong>s, two <strong>Honda</strong>s, two <strong>Kia</strong>s and two <strong>Hyundai</strong>s.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.6670219880973995' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Instead, we looked at the manufacturer rankings and saw just how much repairs for each automaker's vehicles cost, how often they're in the shop, what kind of problems are most common and which represents your best bet when it comes time to buy – regardless of model year. The following 10 automakers represent the best the industry has to offer, but even this list puts a lot of distance between those stuck in traffic and those at the head of the pack:<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>10. BMW</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $355.08 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 3</p>
<p>BMW has exactly one car in CarMD's Top 100 (the 2011 535 at No. 78) and is the only luxury automaker on the list. It dropped off last year, when <strong>Mitsubishi</strong> and <strong>Volkswagen</strong> edged it out, but ranked No. 3 as recently as 2012. Even Toyota and Honda's midsize cars outsell BMW's entire lineup in the U.S., but that's kind of the point, isn't it? Also, despite some wretched performance bythe 2004 BMW 545 and 2004 BMW 745, which rank in the bottom 10% of all cars sold within the past decade, BMW shows reliability that's become all too rare in the luxury sector. Even better, it's most common “check engine light” repair — Inspect for Vacuum Leak at 13.3% of all maintenance — costs $115.52 to fix, on average. Compared with some of the fixes on this list, that's a bargain.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>9. Mazda</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $302.92 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 2.64</p>
<p>Also missing from the list last year, Mazda stepped up by posting the lowest average repair cost of any automaker listed. Despite this, only the 2010 Mazda3 made the Top 100 for reliability (No. 66). The 2009 Mazda 3 just missed the cut at No. 111, but it helps that Mazda's most frequent repair — loose fuel cap at 8.66% — costs nothing to fix. Replacing the vehicle's catalytic converter with one that's up to current standards accounts for 8.23% of all repairs and adds up to nearly $1,000, though. Ouch.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>8. Nissan</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $470.39 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 2.53</p>
<p>Not only does Nissan drop a spot in the rankings, but it goes from five vehicles in the Top 10 to none. Expand that to the Top 100, and its numbers dwindle from 14 vehicles last year to just four in 2014 — the 2010 Murano (No. 38), the 2012 Rogue (No. 67), the 2009 Maxima (No. 69) and 2012 Frontier (No. 85). Older Nissans haven't aged well and drove up the brand's average repair costs from little more than $400 last year. Updating the catalytic converter just crushes the 13.2% of Nissan owners who pay nearly $900 to do so. It doesn't help that its older Nissan Quest minivans are absolutely awful, with the 2006 Quest basically a giant shredder that car owners just keep throwing money into. That vehicle resides in the Bottom 1% that would function better as roadside art.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>7. Kia</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $365 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 2.3</p>
<p>Cheap? No. Inexpensive? With six vehicles in the Top 100 and two in the Top 10 — the 2012 Soul (the top wagon on this list at No. 7) and the 2012 Optima (No. 8) — Kia is becoming a staple on this reliability list. Unfortunately, Kia’s repairs and repair costs were both up, with average price jumping 5% from $346 last year. The $322 oxygen sensor repairs that plague 9.35% are a problem, but that $1,176 catalytic converter replacement required in 7.12% of its vehicles really stings.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>How did Chrysler fall from No. 4 to No. 6 despite dropping average repair costs from $335.38 last year and adding seven vehicles to the Top 100 this year?</p>
<p>Well, there were a whole lot more Chrysler repairs this year, for one. It doesn't matter that the 2012 Jeep Liberty (No. 30), 2011 Dodge Caliber (No. 56), 2012 Fiat 500 (No. 74), 2011 Jeep Wrangler (No. 77), 2013 Chrysler Town &amp; Country (No. 83), 2012 Challenger (No. 88), 2011 Jeep Wrangler (No. 99) and 2009 Caliber (no. 99) are all on the list. If they're in the shop, they're a liability.</p>

Its top issue is a wonky gas cap that costs nothing cents to replace and its costliest repair – that pesky catalytic converter that needs replacement in 4.63% of all cars at $921 a pop – ranks No. 5 beneath repairs that each cost $235 or less.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Ford has no cars in the Top 10, but accounts for nearly a quarter of the Top 100 with 24 cars on the list. Its F-Series pickups sweep the truck category and portions of its lineup as diverse as the Mustang and Edge SUV share space on the list, with every Ford Focus from 2008 through 2013 making the cut.</p>
<p>While its vehicles don't need repairs often, those few fixes get costly. Roughlyly 8.6% of Ford owners shell out $448 to change the ignition coil and spark plugs, while another 4% are set back $891 when they have to replace the control module for their antilock brakes.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>As GM puts some distance between itself and its government bailout, its cars need fewer repairs and fewer dollars to complete them. Although GM’s average repair cost inched up 8% from $304, it's much less than the 18% percent hike in repair costs it experienced two years ago. The 11 vehicles it had in the Top 100 last year have been whittled to five, though — the 2011 Buick Enclave (no. 25), 2005 Buick Century (no. 34), 2001 GMC Acadia (no. 80), 2009 Pontiac Vibe (no. 81) and 2012 GMC Terrain (no. 92).

<p>Man, does it cost a lot to fix a Toyota.</p>
<p>CarMD and Toyota want you to notice 17 Toyotas and four Lexus vehicles in the Top 100, including the 2012 Camry at No. 1. That's fine, but it's tough to get past that highest-on-the-list repair cost that's somehow down from $520 last year. We realize it varies from vehicle to vehicle, with the 2011 Camry costing just $153 to fix, on average, but that probably comes as little consolation to the poor unfortunate stuck with $1,284.62 in catalytic converter replacement costs, which account for about 12% of all Toyota repairs. Even worse, that's a full 12% of all Toyota owners. That's only 9.4% of Lexus owners, but their cost for the same job jumps to $1,400. Just tack on another $321 for another 12.4% who have to change their oxygen sensors.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p><strong>2. Hyundai</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $306.34 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.33</p>
<p>It was a brief tenure at the top of this list in 2013, but Hyundai made the most of it. Besides, owners still have a 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty backing them, and Hyundai went from seven to nine vehicles in the Top 100.</p>
<p>What's your best bet? Try the Sonata, which appears twice in the Top 100 thanks to the 2012 (No. 3) and 2013 (No. 5) models. The 2011 sits just beyond the gates at No. 31. It helps that replacing the oxygen sensors ($255) accounts for nearly 15% of all repairs, while a more than $1,000 catalytic converter change is  necessary only about 7.5% of the time.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Just edging Hyundai by a tenth of a point, Honda still has one of the highest repair costs on the list.</p>
<p>Honda placed 13 Hondas and Acuras in the Top 100, including the highly ranked 2012 Civic (the top compact at No. 2) and the 2011 Odyssey (the top minivan at No. 6). The 2007 and 2011 CR-V also took two of the Top 3 spots in the wagon/crossover category.</p>

<p>BMW has exactly one car in CarMD's Top 100 (the 2011 535 at No. 78) and is the only luxury automaker on the list. It dropped off last year, when Mitsubishi and Volkwagen edged it out, but ranked No. 3 as recently as 2012. Mitsubishi's posted a 11% sales increase through the first 11 months of 2013, despite selling fewer overall vehicles than either Ford, General Motors or Chrysler have sold pickup trucks. Even Toyota and Honda's midsize cars outsell BMW's entire lineup in the U.S., but that's kind of the point, isn't it? Also, despite some wretched performance bythe 2004 BMW 545 and 2004 BMW 745, which rank in the bottom 10% of all cars sold within the last decade, BMW shows reliability that's become all too rare in the luxury sector. Even better, it's most common “check engine light” repair — Inspect for Vacuum Leak at 13.3% of all maintenance — costs $115.52 to fix, on average. Compared to some of the fixes on this list, that's a bargain.</p>

Older Nissans haven't aged well and drove up the brand's average repair costs from little more than $400 last year. Updating the catalytic converter just crushes the 13.2% of Nissan owners who pay nearly $900 to do so. It doesn't help that its older Nissan Quest minivans are absolutely awful, with the 2006 Quest basically a giant shredder that car owners just keep throwing money into. That vehicle resides in the Bottom 1% that would function better as roadside art.</p>

Kia</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $365 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 2.3</p>
<p>Cheap? No. Inexpensive? With six vehicles in the Top 100 and two in the Top 10 — the 2012 Soul (the top wagon on this list at No. 7) and the 2012 Optima (No. 8) — Kia is becoming a staple on this reliability list.. Unfortunately, Kia’s repairs and repair costs were both up, with average price jumping 5% from $346 last year. The $322 oxygen sensor repairs that plague 9.35% are a problem, but that $1,176 catalytic converter replacement required in 7.12% of its vehicles really stings.</p>
<p><strong>6. Chrysler <TICKER SYMBOL="FCAU" TYPE="EQUITY" PRIMARY="NO" />  </strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $303.38 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 2.11</p>
<p>How did Chrysler fall from No. 4 to No. 6 despite dropping average repair costs from $335.38 last year and adding seven vehicles to the Top 100 this year?</p>
<p>Well, there were a whole lot more Chrysler repairs this year, for one. It doesn't matter that the 2012 Jeep Liberty (No. 30), 2011 Dodge Caliber (No. 56), 2012 Fiat 500 (No. 74), 2011 Jeep Wrangler (No. 77), 2013 Chrysler Town &amp; Country (No. 83), 2012 Challenger (no. 88), 2011 Jeep Wrangler (No. 99) and 2009 Caliber (no. 99) are all on the list. If they're in the shop, they're a liability.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7625011990809862' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Still, Chrysler gets high marks by keeping costs low. It top issue is a wonky gas cap that costs nothing cents to replace and its costliest repair – that pesky catalytic converter that needs replacement in 4.63% of all cars at $921 a pop – ranks No. 5 beneath repairs that each cost $235 or less.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ford <TICKER SYMBOL="F" TYPE="EQUITY" PRIMARY="NO" />  </strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $397.48 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.84</p>
<p>Ford has no cars in the Top 10, but accounts for nearly a quarter of the Top 100 with 24 cars on the list. Its F-Series pickups sweep the truck category and portions of its lineup as diverse as the Mustang and Edge SUV share space on the list, with every Ford Focus from 2008 through 2013 making the cut.</p>
<p>While its vehicles don't need repairs often, those few fixes get costly. Roughlyly 8.6% of Ford owners shell out $448 to change the ignition coil and spark plugs, while another 4% are set back $891 when they have to replace the control module for their antilock brakes.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.2462410780143116' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div><strong>4. General Motors <TICKER SYMBOL="GM" TYPE="EQUITY" PRIMARY="NO" />  </strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $329.82 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.80</p>
<p>As GM puts some distance between itself and its government bailout, its cars need fewer repairs and fewer dollars to complete them.Although GM’s average repair cost inched up 8% from $304, it's much less than the 18% percent hike in repair costs it experienced two years ago. However, the 11 vehicles it had in the Top 100 last year have whittled down to five — 2011 Buick Enclave (no. 25), 2005 Buick Century (no. 34), 2001 GMC Acadia (no. 80), 2009 Pontiac Vibe (no. 81) and 2012 GMC Terrain (no. 92). No Chevrolet vehicles made cut.</p>
<p><strong>3. Toyota <TICKER SYMBOL="TM" TYPE="EQUITY" PRIMARY="NO" />  </strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $486 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.48</p>
<p>Man, does it cost a lot to fix a Toyota.</p>
<p>Both CarMD and Toyota want you to notice 17 Toyotas and four Lexus vehicles in the Top 100, including the 2012 Camry at No. 1. That's fine, but it's tough to get past that highest-on-the-list repair cost that's somehow down from $520 last year. We realize it varies from vehicle to vehicle, with the 2011 Camry costing just $153 to fix, on average, but that probably comes as little consolation to the poor unfortunate stuck with $1,284.62 in catalytic converter replacement costs, which account for about 12% of all Toyota repairs. Even worse, that's a full 12% of all Toyota owners. That's only 9.4% of Lexus owners, but their cost for the same job jumps to $1,400. Just tack on another $321 for another 12.4% who have to change their oxygen sensors.</p>

Hyundai</strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $306.34 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.33</p>
<p>It was a brief tenure at the top of this list in 2013, but Hyundai made the most of it. Besides, owners still have a 10-year, 100,000-mile warranty backing them, and Hyundai went from seven to nine vehicles in the Top 100.</p>
<p>What's your best bet? Try Sonata, which appears twice in the Top 100 thanks to the 2012 (No. 3) and 2013 (No. 5) models. The 2011 sits just beyond the gates at No. 31. It helps that replacing the oxygen sensors ($255) accounts for nearly 15% of all repairs while a more than $1,000 catalytic converter change is only necessary about 7.5% of the time.</p>
<p><strong>1. Honda <TICKER SYMBOL="HMC" TYPE="EQUITY" PRIMARY="NO" />  </strong> <br >  <strong>Average repair costs:</strong> $388.34 <br >  <strong>Index rating:</strong> 1.32</p>
<p>Just edging Hyundai by a tenth of a point, Honda still has one of the highest repair costs on the list.</p>
<p>Honda placed 13 Hondas and Acuras in the Top 100, including the highly ranked 2012 Civic (the top compact at No. 2) and the 2011 Odyssey (the top minivan at No. 6). The 2007 and 2011 CR-V also took two of the Top 3 spots in the wagon/crossover category.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.3839116725244649' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>However, when a Honda does have a problem, it tends to be a costly one. It's most common issue is a $1,111 change of the catalytic converter (8.6% of all repairs), while nearly lay 4.8% of Honda owners lay out $1,240 to replace the ABS module.</p>

It dropped off last year, when <strong>Mitsubishi<\u002fstrong> and <strong>Volkswagen<\u002fstrong> edged it out, but ranked No. 3 as recently as 2012. Even Toyota and Honda's midsize cars outsell BMW's entire lineup in the U.S., but that's kind of the point, isn't it? Also, despite some wretched performance bythe 2004 BMW 545 and 2004 BMW 745, which rank in the bottom 10% of all cars sold within the past decade, BMW shows reliability that's become all too rare in the luxury sector. Even better, it's most common “check engine light” repair — Inspect for Vacuum Leak at 13.3% of all maintenance — costs $115.52 to fix, on average. Compared with some of the fixes on this list, that's a bargain.<p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-most-reliable-car-brands-driving-the-automobile-industry-in-2014' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"Top 10 Station Wagons with the Most Mileage for Your Money","callout":"The station wagon has slipped into the shadow of the SUV, the crossover and even the minivan, but its changing face is still friendly to cost-conscious car buyers.","authorName":"Jason Notte","authorId":1145802,"url":"/article/top-10-station-wagons-with-the-most-mileage-for-your-money","storyId":13291368,"publishDate":"2015-09-21T19:17:22Z","publishDateAsString":"Sep 21, 2015 3:17 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2016-nissan-juke_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/2016-nissan-juke_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-8cbb610e-0372-4ed5-9d04-ae940b5b2884\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"Why Tricking Out Your Car Can Hurt Its Resale Value","callout":"With new vehicle technology rapidly advancing and perks like moon roofs and large wheels losing value quickly, premium options don't offer much of a premium on the used car market.","authorName":"Jason Notte","authorId":1145802,"url":"/article/why-tricking-out-your-car-can-hurt-its-resale-value","storyId":13277876,"publishDate":"2015-09-14T20:13:15Z","publishDateAsString":"Sep 14, 2015 4:13 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/carinterior_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/carinterior_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos"},{"headline":"Top 10 Tailgating Vehicles For The 2015 Football Season","callout":"When you're trying to shuttle a bunch of fans to the game and feed them all, it helps to have space and features that are perfect for pregaming.","authorName":"Jason Notte","authorId":1145802,"url":"/article/top-10-tailgating-vehicles-for-the-2015-football-season","storyId":13277829,"publishDate":"2015-09-11T21:34:10Z","publishDateAsString":"Sep 11, 2015 5:34 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/mercedes-benz-e450-4matic-wagon_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/mercedes-benz-e450-4matic-wagon_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Autos","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-8bfe2c33-c062-4b34-8b63-c496359a3f20\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"Should You Buy Or Lease Your Car?","callout":"One in four new cars are now leased -

It dropped off last year, when Mitsubishi and Volkwagen edged it out, but ranked No. 3 as recently as 2012. Mitsubishi's posted a 11% sales increase through the first 11 months of 2013, despite selling fewer overall vehicles than either Ford, General Motors or Chrysler have sold pickup trucks. Even Toyota and Honda's midsize cars outsell BMW's entire lineup in the U.S., but that's kind of the point, isn't it? Also, despite some wretched performance bythe 2004 BMW 545 and 2004 BMW 745, which rank in the bottom 10% of all cars sold within the last decade, BMW shows reliability that's become all too rare in the luxury sector. Even better, it's most common “check engine light” repair — Inspect for Vacuum Leak at 13.3% of all maintenance — costs $115.52 to fix, on average. Compared to some of the fixes on this list, that's a bargain.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.3111254424285189' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv><strong>9.

Despite this, only the 2010 Mazda 3 made the Top 100 for reliability (No. 66). The 2009 Mazda 3 just missed the cut at No. 111, but it helps that Mazda's most frequent repair — loose fuel cap at 8.66% — costs nothing to fix. However, replacing the vehicle's catalytic converter with one that's up to current standards accounts for 8.23% of all repairs and adds up to nearly $1,000. Ouch.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><strong>8.

Expand that to the Top 100, and its numbers dwindle from 14 vehicles last year to just four in 2014 — the 2010 Murano (No. 38), the 2012 Rogue (No. 67), the 2009 Maxima (No. 69) and 2012 Frontier (No. 85). Older Nissans haven't aged well and drove up the brand's average repair costs from little more than $400 last year. Updating the catalytic converter just crushes the 13.2% of Nissan owners who pay nearly $900 to do so. It doesn't help that its older Nissan Quest minivans are absolutely awful, with the 2006 Quest basically a giant shredder that car owners just keep throwing money into. That vehicle resides in the Bottom 1% that would function better as roadside art.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9952907091148349' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv><strong>7.

With six vehicles in the Top 100 and two in the Top 10 — the 2012 Soul (the top wagon on this list at No. 7) and the 2012 Optima (No. 8) — Kia is becoming a staple on this reliability list.. Unfortunately, Kia’s repairs and repair costs were both up, with average price jumping 5% from $346 last year. The $322 oxygen sensor repairs that plague 9.35% are a problem, but that $1,176 catalytic converter replacement required in 7.12% of its vehicles really stings.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><strong>6.

However, the 11 vehicles it had in the Top 100 last year have whittled down to five — 2011 Buick Enclave (no. 25), 2005 Buick Century (no. 34), 2001 GMC Acadia (no. 80), 2009 Pontiac Vibe (no. 81) and 2012 GMC Terrain (no. 92).

That's fine, but it's tough to get past that highest-on-the-list repair cost that's somehow down from $520 last year. We realize it varies from vehicle to vehicle, with the 2011 Camry costing just $153 to fix, on average, but that probably comes as little consolation to the poor unfortunate stuck with $1,284.62 in catalytic converter replacement costs, which account for about 12% of all Toyota repairs. Even worse, that's a full 12% of all Toyota owners. That's only 9.4% of Lexus owners, but their cost for the same job jumps to $1,400.
