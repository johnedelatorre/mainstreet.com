After a surge of last minute shopping before the March deadline, 7.1 million Americans have signed up for insurance through either the federal or state exchanges. This beats even administration projections of 7 million enrollees.</p>
<p><a target="blank" data-add-tracking="true" href="can-obamacare-be-mended.html"><strong><em>Also See: Can Obamacare Be Mended?</em></strong></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this announcement has renewed debate over whether the ACA actually works. Flagging enrollments going into last month renewed criticism of the law, especially regarding whether enough so-called "<a target="blank" data-add-tracking="true" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/family/family-health/brosurance-tries-sell-obamacare-will-it-work-0">young healthies</a>" would sign up. Now, those critics question whether the 7 million number actually means anything.</p>
<p><a target="blank" data-add-tracking="true" href="http://www.mainstreet.com/article/family/family-health/zach-galifianakis-hosts-obama-between-two-ferns-part-obamacare-promotio"><strong><em>Also See: Zach Galifianakis Hosts Obama on "Between Two Ferns" As Part of Obamacare Promotion</em></strong></a></p>
<p>They're right to do so. The national volume of enrollees is fairly meaningless and has nothing to do with insurance or public policy. It's simply a goal that the Obama administration set up, one that become adopted by the press as a de-facto finish line for success. The important issues lie behind the numbers, in the nuts and bolts of who enrolled and where they come from.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.5000643604475659' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div><a target="blank" data-add-tracking="true" href="why-some-people-are-refusing-health-care.html"><strong><em>Also See: Why Some People Are Refusing Health Care</em></strong></a></p>
<p>If the finish line means nothing, instead we should measure the success of the ACA by how well it has achieved its two main goals: expanding access to health care and reducing costs. The results are mixed positives. At the end of the ACA's first enrollment period we're better off than we were before, but still have a long way to go. But first...</p>
<p><strong>The 7 Million Means Nothing</strong></p>
<p>The much heralded 7 million enrollees on its own is a fairly meaningless number. The real question is whether the ACA will create stable, affordable risk pools moving forward, and that issue is all about percentages. It matters much less how many people enroll than what that population looks like.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obamacare-hits-7-million-mark-does-mean-its-working' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>What's more, health insurance is a local business. It creates risk pools by state and premiums by local markets and companies. Judging the success of the ACA by nationwide enrollment is like using the national debt to judge a personal loan. The figure of 7 million people doesn't mean anything; what matters is who they are and where they live. How many people enrolled on a state-by-state basis, and how healthy are they? Those are the questions that will determine prices and sustainability.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.8515917113238088' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>What each risk pool looks like on a local and policy level will determine premiums. None of this has to do with nationwide enrollment.</p>
<p>Having lots of people participate in the ACA is generally a positive for the law from a political and perception standpoint, but from an insurance and policy point of view, it means next to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Access to Healthcare</strong></p>
<p>This is Obamacare's unalloyed success story. According to Gallup, the number of uninsured Americans has fallen to its lowest level since the economic collapse of 2008, reaching 14.5% in the second half of March. This accomplishment is particularly noteworthy in the context of a continuously struggling job market; not only do more Americans have insurance, but they have it in an era of poor employment when the traditional employer-provided model increasingly fails them.</p>
<p>Many critics claim that only a small number of these 7 million enrollees are newly insured, arguing that a flawed system only succeeded in achieving the status quo. This argument fails on two levels.</p>
<p>First, these voices rely on a recent study by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. to show that only 14% of enrollees were previously uninsured. Like many things in politics (and unfortunately, increasingly, in journalism), this is accurate but not true.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7691427851412533' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>In fact, the study says that approximately one in four new enrollees were previously uninsured. Critics shave that number down by discounting anyone who hadn't paid their first bill by the time McKinsey called, pretending this is a population of deadbeats who won't pay and so don't count. These were generally premiums due in either April or May discussed back in March.</p>
<p>The issue of payment also has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not an enrollee in 2014 had insurance of 2013.</p>
<p>Finally, McKinsey's number includes all new enrollments for 2014. This means that it counted everyone simply renewing existing policies through his or her insurer, not just people enrolling through the ACA exchanges. "If you're looking to zero in on that," a spokesperson from the consulting firm told Politifact, "we don't have that detail."</p>
<p>The second problem with this argument, aside from its profound intellectual dishonesty, that the Affordable Care Act is actually a complicated series of reforms. The exchanges are certainly the most visible part, but looking only at direct enrollment obscures everything happening behind the scenes.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.5213402352311718' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>It's difficult, if not impossible, to create a but-for count of how many people have insurance now due to the Medicaid expansion, the ban on canceled policies, the ban on pre-existing conditions, the employer mandates, the coverage extension for adult children and more. The closest we can come is to look at how the absolute number of uninsureds has fallen. By and on that metric, the over 85% of Americans who now have health insurance make this law a profound success.</p>
<p>By this metric the law is either a success or not for certain definitions of the word "cost." As Drew Altman, president of the <a target="blank" href="http://kff.org/health-costs/perspective/health-cost-growth-is-down-or-not-it-depends-who-you-ask/">Kaiser Foundation</a>, wrote last month, "[s]tudies show that health care costs have been rising more slowly than at any time in the last fifty years, but the American people think they are rising faster than ever. Who's right, the experts or the public? They both are, they just look at the problem from different perspectives."</p>
<p>This, in a nutshell, is exactly right. Whether or not the Affordable Care Act keeps costs down depends on whether you look at this from a systemic perspective or from the point of view of the individual American.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.39134082322872676' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>As an effort to bring down the amount of money America and Americans spend on health care, the ACA seems to work. One of the signature achievements of our private insurance system over the past few generations has been to get fewer people worse results for far more money than any of our peer nations. Health reform needs to fix that and, economy-wide, the ACA has made some progress.</p>
<p>For five straight years health spending has grown at historically low rates. It's called "bending the curve," and while that's not as good as actually reducing spending, it's considerably better than anyone else has managed to accomplish so far. Nonpartisan experts generally agree that it is caused in large part by the ACA. (Common sense would suggest the same conclusion.)</p>
<p>That's the good news. For individuals, the numbers don't look as good.</p>
<p>As far as individuals go, health care spending continues to increase. Systemically reduced increases and terms like "bending the curve" aren't much comfort to someone whose premium and copay ticks up year after year. Good news for an economist often means little on Main Street.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9460846794246777' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Insurance is a wealth transfer system. Any program, whether private or government, works on this principle. The healthy pay for more than they need so the sick can pay for less than they consume. This works well for the poor and middle class who get a buffer against the potentially ruinous costs of illness, but less so for the wealthy who potentially spend a lifetime overpaying to protect against an otherwise affordable expense.</p>
<p>The ACA has expanded this system and cut out price controls that insurance companies used on more expensive clients (the old and sick). Premiums have gone up in 2014. How much varies state by state, but overall it hasn't been too bad. Yet. Some forecasts suggest up to triple digit increases for individual plans in coming years, which could lead to Americans shoveling an awful lot of money at insurance companies. This would be a big problem and a considerable failure.</p>
<p>If it happens. When we actually know how many young and healthy people enrolled.</p>
<p>We don't actually know either of those things yet. The law hasn't necessarily failed if some premiums increase. No one likes to pay more, but at the same time nothing comes for free. If the price of admission is that the more fortunate among us pay marginally more to help protect our fellow citizens, advocates of the law would argue that as a success.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.03361755138542377' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Opponents of the law disagree. They argue that any increase in premiums is a failure. Obamacare is supposed to cut costs and instead the average American ended up paying more. Res ipsa loquitor, as the lawyers say: the thing speaks for itself.</p>
<p>The reality is somewhere in the middle. Demanding success based only on how much the law accomplishes for free is a straw man argument. It sets up a test that the ACA can only fail.</p>
<p>Instead we should judge success by whether or not Obamacare is worth the price. By that metric the answer is a guarded maybe. Overall spending on healthcare has grown more slowly than in decades. Premiums have had only marginal increases nationwide, but they have gone up. In exchange, millions more Americans have access to desperately needed care. So far the law seems to work.</p>
<p>Mostly. For now. The dirty little secret behind all the noise surrounding Obamacare is that no one knows much of anything for sure. That's precisely why everyone has so much to say. We don't know how well the ACA will work in the long run. Until we do there's plenty of ink to be spilled pretending.</p>

This argument fails on two levels.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>First, these voices rely on a recent study by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. to show that only 14% of enrollees were previously uninsured. Like many things in politics (and unfortunately, increasingly, in journalism), this is accurate but not true.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.7691427851412533' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>In fact, the study says that approximately one in four new enrollees were previously uninsured. Critics shave that number down by discounting anyone who hadn't paid their first bill by the time McKinsey called, pretending this is a population of deadbeats who won't pay and so don't count. These were generally premiums due in either April or May discussed back in March.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The issue of payment also has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not an enrollee in 2014 had insurance of 2013.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Finally, McKinsey's number includes all new enrollments for 2014. This means that it counted everyone simply renewing existing policies through his or her insurer, not just people enrolling through the ACA exchanges. \"If you're looking to zero in on that,\" a spokesperson from the consulting firm told Politifact, \"we don't have that detail.\"<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The second problem with this argument, aside from its profound intellectual dishonesty, that the Affordable Care Act is actually a complicated series of reforms. The exchanges are certainly the most visible part, but looking only at direct enrollment obscures everything happening behind the scenes.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.5213402352311718' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>It's difficult, if not impossible, to create a but-for count of how many people have insurance now due to the Medicaid expansion, the ban on canceled policies, the ban on pre-existing conditions, the employer mandates, the coverage extension for adult children and more. The closest we can come is to look at how the absolute number of uninsureds has fallen. By and on that metric, the over 85% of Americans who now have health insurance make this law a profound success.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>By this metric the law is either a success or not for certain definitions of the word \"cost.\" As Drew Altman, president of the <a target=\"blank\" href=\"http://kff.org/health-costs/perspective/health-cost-growth-is-down-or-not-it-depends-who-you-ask/\">Kaiser Foundation<\u002fa>, wrote last month, \"[s]tudies show that health care costs have been rising more slowly than at any time in the last fifty years, but the American people think they are rising faster than ever. Who's right, the experts or the public? They both are, they just look at the problem from different perspectives.\"<\u002fp>\r\n<p>This, in a nutshell, is exactly right. Whether or not the Affordable Care Act keeps costs down depends on whether you look at this from a systemic perspective or from the point of view of the individual American.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.39134082322872676' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>As an effort to bring down the amount of money America and Americans spend on health care, the ACA seems to work. One of the signature achievements of our private insurance system over the past few generations has been to get fewer people worse results for far more money than any of our peer nations. Health reform needs to fix that and, economy-wide, the ACA has made some progress.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>For five straight years health spending has grown at historically low rates. It's called \"bending the curve,\" and while that's not as good as actually reducing spending, it's considerably better than anyone else has managed to accomplish so far. Nonpartisan experts generally agree that it is caused in large part by the ACA. (Common sense would suggest the same conclusion.)<\u002fp>\r\n<p>That's the good news. For individuals, the numbers don't look as good.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>As far as individuals go, health care spending continues to increase. Systemically reduced increases and terms like \"bending the curve\" aren't much comfort to someone whose premium and copay ticks up year after year. Good news for an economist often means little on Main Street.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.9460846794246777' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Insurance is a wealth transfer system. Any program, whether private or government, works on this principle. The healthy pay for more than they need so the sick can pay for less than they consume. This works well for the poor and middle class who get a buffer against the potentially ruinous costs of illness, but less so for the wealthy who potentially spend a lifetime overpaying to protect against an otherwise affordable expense.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The ACA has expanded this system and cut out price controls that insurance companies used on more expensive clients (the old and sick). Premiums have gone up in 2014. How much varies state by state, but overall it hasn't been too bad. Yet. Some forecasts suggest up to triple digit increases for individual plans in coming years, which could lead to Americans shoveling an awful lot of money at insurance companies. This would be a big problem and a considerable failure.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>If it happens. When we actually know how many young and healthy people enrolled.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>We don't actually know either of those things yet. The law hasn't necessarily failed if some premiums increase. No one likes to pay more, but at the same time nothing comes for free. If the price of admission is that the more fortunate among us pay marginally more to help protect our fellow citizens, advocates of the law would argue that as a success.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.03361755138542377' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Opponents of the law disagree. They argue that any increase in premiums is a failure. Obamacare is supposed to cut costs and instead the average American ended up paying more. Res ipsa loquitor, as the lawyers say: the thing speaks for itself.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The reality is somewhere in the middle. Demanding success based only on how much the law accomplishes for free is a straw man argument. It sets up a test that the ACA can only fail.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Instead we should judge success by whether or not Obamacare is worth the price. By that metric the answer is a guarded maybe. Overall spending on healthcare has grown more slowly than in decades. Premiums have had only marginal increases nationwide, but they have gone up. In exchange, millions more Americans have access to desperately needed care. So far the law seems to work.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Mostly. For now. The dirty little secret behind all the noise surrounding Obamacare is that no one knows much of anything for sure. That's precisely why everyone has so much to say. We don't know how well the ACA will work in the long run. Until we do there's plenty of ink to be spilled pretending.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><em>--Written for MainStreet by Eric Reed, a freelance journalist who writes frequently on the subjects of career and travel.
