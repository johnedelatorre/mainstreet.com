<p>It seems like a distant memory now, but the most infamous version of Justin Timberlake's “Rock Your Body” ever performed is still with us today. By tearing into Janet Jackson's wardrobe and revealing to the world less than a second of her nipple shield (not a pasty, but a piercing that surrounds the nipple and covers the areo ... never mind), Timberlake let loose a stream of fines, censorship and moralization that didn't wane until nearly a decade later. Clear Channel began editing songs, networks toned down soap operas and the Federal Communications Commission fined CBS, only to be overturned in a court battle that wasn't settled until 2011.</p>
<p>Sponsor AOL asked for its $7.5 million back, MTV parent Viacom paid out millions to settle lawsuits from disgruntled viewers and the “Rock The Vote” team led to a vote that was rocked by morally outraged portions of the U.S. audience. In <a href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/13442759/1/5-super-bowl-commercials-that-want-a-bite-of-your-game-day-snacks.html" target="_blank">Super Bowl terms</a>, however, this meant that nobody remotely young would serve as a halftime headliner for roughly eight years.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.5392380866779912' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>From 2005 through 2012, the average age of a Super Bowl halftime performer was 52. That included nobody under 30 and seven headliners over the AARP cutoff age of 55: Paul McCartney in 2005 (62), Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 2006 (each 62), Tom Petty in 2008 (57), Bruce Springsteen in 2009 (59) and The Who's Roger Daltrey (65) and Pete Townshend (64) in 2010. Even when the show decided to go "young" with Beyoncé in 2013, she was 31 and 16 years removed from her major-label debut with Destiny's Child.</p>

<p>Super Bowl XXVII</p>
<p>Jan. 31, 1993</p>
<p>Pasadena, Calif.</p>
<p>Why #5 for the King of Pop, you ask? Because the Super Bowl didn't really know how to handle pop music before this and didn't do that great a job with MJ once he was there.</p>
<p>You have to remember that, just a year before, CBS put on a halftime show featuring a figure skating performance from Brian Boitano and Dorothy Hamill and exactly two songs from adult-contemporary favorite Gloria Estefan. Newcomer network Fox saw this and previous halftime efforts involving marching bands, Elvis impersonators and the impossibly perky chorus Up With People and put together a special halftime edition its sketch comedy show<em> In Living Color</em>. The halftime version of the show that gave the world Jim Carrey, David Alan Grier and the entire Wayans family drew more than 20 million viewers away from a Super Bowl telecast that averaged 80 million viewers throughout, convincing one in four viewers to outright change the channel on the NFL's biggest event.</p>
<p>Radio City and Don Mischner wooed Jackson for NBC's Super Bowl the next year and got him to perform “Jam,” “Billie Jean” and “Black or White” before making him the centerpiece of a giant stadium-wide card trick for “We Are The World” and “Heal The World.” Ratings were through the roof, and it was determined that pop music would be a great play from that point on. Sadly, just about nobody knew what to do with it until a certain music network came along and took over the reins.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Super Bowl XXXV</p>
<p>Jan. 28, 2001</p>
<p>Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p>What did the NFL and its halftime producers learn from Michael Jackson's performance? Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>In the years that followed, audiences were subjected to an Indiana Jones stunt show, a Blues Brothers revue, a Motown 40th anniversary special and something Disney called the “Tapestry of Nations” (which was a nice way of saying, “We're going to have Tina Turner, Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias and Toni Braxton in the same building together and have them perform almost none of their own music...”).</p>
<p>When the Super Bowl did manage to focus a bit, it either trotted out Diana Ross for Super Bowl XXX solely because she was huge 30 years before or it uncomfortably paired Stevie Wonder with Gloria Estefan (who, if you haven't figured it out, is basically Super Bowl Kryptonite). MTV not only turned that around with its “Kings of Rock and Pop” show that featured relevant acts performing songs people knew, but it made sure that classic-rock Aerosmith was flanked by Timberlake and N*SYNC or by Nelly, Blige and Spears whenever possible.</p>

<p><strong>3. U2</strong></p>
<p>Super Bowl XXXVI</p>
<p>Feb. 3, 2002</p>
<p>New Orleans</p>
<p>In an admittedly tough spot, U2 and Clear Channel came through.</p>
<p>Less than a year after the September 11 attacks, there was still a whole lot of uneasiness about how this should go down. The NFL had already shut down games that season, baseball playoff and World Series games were paused for announcements from the president and the atmosphere surrounding the St. Louis Rams-New England Patriots matchup wasn't altogether that festive. In the Patriots' backyard, families were still grieving.</p>
<p>U2 and Clear Channel dedicated the halftime performance to victims of the attacks and kept the whole thing to roughly 12 minutes. The names of victims scrolled over the band as it played through the solemn “MLK” and continued to do so as they played “Where The Streets Have No Name.” By the time Bono revealed the Stars and Stripes lining his jacket, the crowd at the Superdome was deafening. It's an admittedly awkward affair to watch 15 years later, and something about the names of the dead scrolling over an uptempo performance of “Where The Streets Have No Name” still doesn't sit quite right, but it hit the right note at the time.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Super Bowl XLVI</p>
<p>Feb. 3, 2012</p>
<p>Indianapolis, Ind.</p>
<p>No, Madonna wasn't the first pop act to perform at the Super Bowl after Nipplegate, but she emphatically placed pop music's stamp back on the event.</p>
<p>The Black Eyed Peas performed a year earlier and, helped largely by Pittsburgh Steelers and Green Bay Packers fans, managed to hold little more than 107 million of the game's 111 million viewers. However, Madonna came in a year later and not only owned the joint as soon as she hit the opening notes of “Vogue,” but overloaded the senses of her entire audience by cramming her sets with Cirque du Soleil acrobats, high school marching bands, dance troupes, drumlines, a 200-person choir and, oh yeah, LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and Cee Lo Green.</p>
<p>Yes, M.I.A. flipped off nine figures worth of audience, but Madonna and Cee Lo proceeded to bring the house down with “Like A Prayer” -- a song that, itself, managed to scandalize the nation more than two decades before when its video was released. When the world seems to be in a constant state of outrage, just remember that it's still a world in which Madonna was perhaps the most benign aspect of a Super Bowl halftime built around her.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Super Bowl XLI</p>
<p>Feb. 4, 2007</p>
<p>Miami</p>
<p>Man, your dad's CD collection had a <em>great</em> time at the Super Bowl for a few years there. Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, The Rolling Stones, The Who... gray hair, wrinkles, electric guitars and the rockin' songs of yesteryear just kept rolling as the NFL did everything it could to keep evil, cootie-having women from ever performing and threatening us with their anatomy again.</p>
<p>This is where we remind you that, in the middle of this, Prince went behind a sheet during a Super Bowl halftime show, turned his guitar into an extension of his most princely of appendages and proceeded to work the fretboard. Oh, and when he wasn't doing that, he basically melted the place down by making every other aging guitar slinger that came before or after him look foolish.</p>
<p>He not only tore into his own catalog with “Let's Go Crazy,” but took Tina Turner, Foo Fighters and Queen songs and turned them into Paisley Park features. By the time he'd shut it down with “Purple Rain,” he'd made it clear that the NFL not only underestimated him as a “classic rock” act, but also made it seem awfully silly to be scared of a little interlude of sexiness and funk in a game where 300-pound individuals are actively concussing each other.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

By the time he'd shut it down with “Purple Rain,” he'd made it clear that the NFL not only underestimated him as a “classic rock” act, but also made it seem awfully silly to be scared of a little interlude of sexiness and funk in a game where 300-pound individuals are actively concussing each other.<\u002fp><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/5-super-bowl-halftime-shows-that-made-you-hold-it-in' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"The Big CareFirst Health Insurer Data Breach: Another 1 Million Records Stolen","callout":"Consumers are singing the Blues, as more Blue Cross Blue Shield records are stolen.","authorName":"Robert McGarvey","authorId":1610501,"url":"/article/the-big-carefirst-health-insurer-data-breach-another-1-million-records-stolen","storyId":13161018,"publishDate":"2015-05-22T13:52:53Z","publishDateAsString":"May 22, 2015 9:52 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bluecross-large_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bluecross-large_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Financial Planning","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-4f869b40-2b21-40a3-894e-b6b8fe648d86\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"One Last Lesson for College Grads: How to Get a Job When You're Starting From Zero","callout":"Here's a crash course for the young adults who have never set foot in a school career guidance office or held an internship and don't know how to find employment.","authorName":"Brian O'Connell","authorId":459200,"url":"/article/one-last-lesson-for-college-grads-how-to-get-a-job-when-youre-starting-from-zero","storyId":13159255,"publishDate":"2015-05-22T12:37:29Z","publishDateAsString":"May 22, 2015 8:37 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/collegegraduationceremony_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/collegegraduationceremony_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Financial Planning"},{"headline":"Not All Millennials Are Guilty Of Bolting When Bored On The Job","callout":"The number one driving force in the workplace for younger workers is meaningful work.","authorName":"Juliette Fairley","authorId":1598405,"url":"/article/not-all-millennials-are-guilty-of-bolting-when-bored-on-the-job","storyId":13154982,"publishDate":"2015-05-21T16:02:59Z","publishDateAsString":"May 21, 2015 12:02 PM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/millennialsworking_139x90.jpg","largeThumbUrl":"//s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/millennialsworking_600x400.jpg","subcategoryName":"Financial Planning","adUnit":"<div id=\"ad-div-3fd6bf67-b9c2-4c84-9683-949fe0ea212a\" class=\"googleAd unit\" data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-unit=\"gpt-ad\" data-ad-sizes=\"300,250\"><\u002fdiv>"},{"headline":"PwC Financial Literacy Program Targets Students and Their Teachers","callout":"Shannon Schuyler, Principal and Corporate Responsibility Leader at PwC, discusses \"Earn Your Future,\" which is a financial literacy program aimed at more than 2.5-million students.","authorName":"Rhonda Schaffler","authorId":1652612,"url":"/video/pwc-financial-literacy-program-targets-students-and-their-teachers","storyId":13159160,"publishDate":"2015-05-21T12:30:00Z","publishDateAsString":"May 21, 2015 8:30 AM EDT","smallThumbUrl":"//vid.thestreet.com//p/105/sp/10500/thumbnail/entry_id/0_fv6g37gm/version/100001/width/139/height/90","largeThumbUrl":"//vid.thestreet.com//p/105/sp/10500/thumbnail/entry_id/0_fv6g37gm/version/100001/width/600/height/400","subcategoryName":"Financial Planning"},{"headline":"What 14% Unemployment Means for the Class of 2015","callout":"A still-bloated youth unemployment rate may delay graduates from finding their dream jobs, funding their retirement and buying homes.
