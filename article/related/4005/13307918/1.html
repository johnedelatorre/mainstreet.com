<p>You couldn't possibly make that more clear. Average gas prices have slid below $2, according to AAA, which is why 16.7% more of you bought SUVs and crossovers last year than you did in 2015. Car sales declined 2.2% as light-duty truck sales -- including SUVs and crossovers -- jumped 13.1%. Even the old-school truck-based SUV saw huge gains, with that subcategory seeing a 10.7% increase in sales behind midsize (15.5% increase), small (8.2%) and luxury (16.7%) SUV resurgence.</p>
<p>However, that love isn't spread equally. Large SUVs that thundered across the landscape in the early to mid 2000s saw sales drop 4.5% from the year before. In fact, though automakers sold more than 4.5 million crossovers in 2015, sales of large SUVs scarcely eclipsed 280,000. In fact, those large SUVs, along with small SUVs(255,000) and luxury SUVs (228,000) combined, failed to match even the sales of midsize SUVs (943,000). Also, despite this year's cheap fuel and fast sales, the future of the standard SUV isn't looking all that bright.</p>
<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.8661403203651132' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder="true"  data-ad-defer="true" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'></div>Fleet-wide fuel efficiency standards still need to make it to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, as declared by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in 2015 was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that they set back in 2012, though it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980.</p>
<p>That standard exists, because gas prices don't stay this way forever. Prices topped $4 a gallon less than a decade ago, and any number of global and economic anomalies can send them back there again. Still, if you're looking for a whole lot of space and gas money is no object, there are still some huge SUVs out there looking for a home. We consulted with the folks at Edmunds and the EPA's FuelEconomy.gov and found just ten SUVs built for soft gas prices:<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The Armada and the pickup truck it's based on, the Titan, haven't had a serious upgrade since their debut in 2003. In a certain throw-back mindset here, George W. Bush is still president, the truck-based SUV still rules the American road and Sean Paul is still blaring out of every CD player in the country.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's perfectly acceptable for the fuel “efficient” two-wheel-drive version of this SUV to get a combined 15.5 miles per gallon. There's a new Armada coming in this year, but most of the drivers from this vehicles heyday have since cashed in their giant, fuel-slurping clunkers.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>The words "Mazda" and "big" don't tend to occupy the same sentence. The Mazda 5, the company's attempt at a minivan, has only 44 cubic feet of cargo space at its largest. Its most iconic car -- the MX-5 Miata -- is a two-seater.</p>

With 139 cubic feet of passenger room and maximum cargo capacity of nearly 101 cubic feet, it's absolutely cavernous.

<p>You could pick the less-expensive GMC Acadia or Chevrolet Traverse for this list, but you're here for the perks. Of the Lambda platform trio of General Motors crossovers, this one shares the others' ability to turn into a wireless hotspot and all of their space.</p>
<p>They all have roughly the same electronics package, they all seat eight passengers, but only this one comes with leather seats, wood trim, a Bose ten-speaker sound system and an incredibly quiet cabin thanks to its forgiving suspension, extra seals and laminated glass. Quiet, cushy, beautiful and more expensive than the more utilitarian model on the non-luxe marque: that's just about everything you can hope for in a luxury vehicle.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>It's the slightly less luxurious version of GM's three-row “midsize” SUVs, but it still has the great little touches like ambient lighting, underfloor storage, rear-vision camera, touchscreen entertainment system and available OnStar 4G LTE that turns your Acadia into a wireless hotspot.</p>
<p>Oh, and it actually has about a cubic foot of storage more than the Enclave, which is a tough tradeoff for all that luxurious trim.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Built on the same platform as the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, this is the entry-level version of GM's Lambda crossover platform. Aside from window dressing, there really isn't much separating the three.</p>
<p>They all have roughly the same electronics package featuring the MyLink radio and apps-based entertainment system. They all seat eight passengers comfortably. They all have roughly the same amount of combined cargo space, which is the best in their class.</p>

Because a family on a budget doesn't need to blow $8,000 extra on the Buick's luxury appointments. $34,000 isn't cheap by any means, but it also isn't more than $40,000. Besides, the 1LT will get you a remote starter, rear parking assist, an eight-way power adjustable driver's seat and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Total cargo volume: 120.9 cubic feet</p>

<p>Nothing about that figure is “efficient,” but then again the Escalade is one of the few SUVs on the EPA's list that doesn't flat-out lie.</p>
<p>Though demand for this vehicle in the U.S. has dropped from a peak of more than 62,000 in 2006 to little more than 30,000 in 2014, the refreshed-in-2015 Escalade still provides creature comforts like 94.2 cubic inches of cargo space, a General Motors 6.2-liter EcoTec3 V8 engine with 420 horsepower, the Cadillac CUE infotainment system, lane assistance and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.</p>
<p>No, you likely aren't muddily off-roading in an Escalade, but you won't be spinning your wheels, either.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Sticking the Tundra's 5.7-liter, 381-horsepower V8 in a honking-big SUV is just going to yield the same results with less bed space. Built on the same platform as the Tundra, the Sequoia is yet another large SUV riding the small wave of buyers still clamoring for vehicles like it. Toyota tweaks the interior technology every few years or so, but the Sequoia has gone fundamentally unchanged since 2007. All of the above has contributed to a dramatic decrease in the Sequoia's popularity, with just 11,000 selling in the U.S. in 2014 compared to 70,000 at the vehicle's peak in 2002.</p>
<p>However, it can tow 7,400 pound;, has room for eight passengers; has power reclining seats for passengers in the third row, one-touch moonroof; and has the Entune infotainment system standard. It's yet another full-size pickup with a cap on it, but it delivers a lot for its bulk.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>This a GMC Sierra/Chevy Silverado turned into a rolling apartment. Don't believe us? Check out the 5.3-liter, 355-horsepower V8 engine. Then get a look at the automated safety including forward collision alert, front and rear park assist, side blind zone alert, lane change alert, lane keep assist, rear cross traffic alert, adaptive headlights and available adaptive cruise control. Those may not be super rugged, but they make this already-quiet ride a whole lot safer than the rollover-prone SUVs of the past.</p>
<p>With an infotainment system, keyless entry and push-button start, standard rear vision camera, 110v three-prong household style outlet, rain-sensing wipers and a wireless device charger -- as well as OnStar 4G LTE and Wi-Fi -- it's a bit more tech savvy than it looks.

<p>If you aren't working as a security contractor -- or living in Texas -- chances are you just aren't buying the stretched version of this beast anymore.</p>
<p>As with much of the SUV market, the Navigator's free-spending run rolled downhill in the late 2000s. The nearly 44,000 Navigators sold when the vehicle was introduced in 1998 dwindled to 24,000 just as the financial crisis began in 2007. By 2014, Ford could only manage to part with 10,422, which was actually a vast improvement from just 8,600 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The Navigator got a facelift in 2015 and really made the EcoBoost V6 engine work for its name. It still manages only a combined 19 miles per gallon while generating 380 horsepower. It's actually more concerned with blinding headlamps, LED running lights and full LED taillights and the 20-inch rims that replaced its standard 18s. If you'd like to relive the pre-recession 2000s, there's even a reserve model with 22-inch wheels. New features include the 8-inch MyLincoln Touch display with SYNC standard, as well as a push-button starter, passive entry and a rear-view camera to go with leather seating and a bunch of other luxury features we're sure the dealer can talk about at length.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>Yep, it's an absolute dinosaur of an SUV with non-crossover blood whatsoever and a paltry 19 miles per gallon of combined mileage. Yes, this supersized EL version with eight more cubic feet of passenger volume and almost 22 more cubic feet of total cargo space that drops combined efficiency to 18 miles per gallon. But that isn't what we're here to discuss.</p>
<p>The Toyota 4Runner's cargo space with the seats up (47.2 cubic feet) is bigger than the Expedition's. Meanwhile, the Mercedes-Benz GL's space with the rear seats gone (93 cubic feet) outclasses the Expedition's 85.5 cubic feet without its last row. However, only the Expedition's luxury sibling -- the Lincoln Navigator with its 128 cubic feet of maximum cargo space -- and GM's Chevrolet Suburban/Cadillac Escalade tandem (121 cubic feet) come close to the Expedition's hangar of a frame.</p>
<p>Just how big is 130.8 cubic feet in SUV terms? It's more nearly double the total cargo capacity KBB's roomiest small SUV, the Nissan Rogue (at 70 cubic feet), and about as much maximum cargo space as the Subaru Forester (74.7) and Nissan Xterra (65.7) combined. The passengers get a decent deal, too, with 28 inches of legroom in the third row, 29 inches in the second and 42 up front.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Average gas prices have slid below $2, according to AAA, which is why 16.7% more of you bought SUVs and crossovers last year than you did in 2015. Car sales declined 2.2% as light-duty truck sales -- including SUVs and crossovers -- jumped 13.1%. Even the old-school truck-based SUV saw huge gains, with that subcategory seeing a 10.7% increase in sales behind midsize (15.5% increase), small (8.2%) and luxury (16.7%) SUV resurgence.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>However, that love isn't spread equally. Large SUVs that thundered across the landscape in the early to mid 2000s saw sales drop 4.5% from the year before. In fact, though automakers sold more than 4.5 million crossovers in 2015, sales of large SUVs scarcely eclipsed 280,000. In fact, those large SUVs, along with small SUVs(255,000) and luxury SUVs (228,000) combined, failed to match even the sales of midsize SUVs (943,000). Also, despite this year's cheap fuel and fast sales, the future of the standard SUV isn't looking all that bright.<\u002fp>\r\n<p><div id='div-gpt-ad-0.8661403203651132' class='googleAd unit'  data-is-placeholder=\"true\"  data-ad-defer=\"true\" data-ad-sizes='320,50' data-devices='mobile|tablet' data-custom-size-mapping='articleMobileMapping'><\u002fdiv>Fleet-wide fuel efficiency standards still need to make it to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, as declared by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, the average fuel economy (window-sticker value) of new vehicles sold in 2015 was 25.3 mpg, according to the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. That's still less than halfway to the EPA and Department of Transportation's goal that they set back in 2012, though it beats the roughly 19 miles per gallon that the Department of Transportation measured for the same pool of vehicles in 1995. It's also closing in on double the average mileage of the light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 1980.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>That standard exists, because gas prices don't stay this way forever. Prices topped $4 a gallon less than a decade ago, and any number of global and economic anomalies can send them back there again. Still, if you're looking for a whole lot of space and gas money is no object, there are still some huge SUVs out there looking for a home. We consulted with the folks at Edmunds and the EPA's FuelEconomy.gov and found just ten SUVs built for soft gas prices:<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'><\u002fdiv><script><\u002fscript>","relatedContent":{"trendingStories":[{"headline":"10 SUVs to Get While Gas Is Cheap","callout":"SUV sales spiked in 2015 as gas prices slid.

The nearly 44,000 Navigators sold when the vehicle was introduced in 1998 dwindled to 24,000 just as the financial crisis began in 2007. By 2014, Ford could only manage to part with 10,422, which was actually a vast improvement from just 8,600 a year earlier.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>The Navigator got a facelift in 2015 and really made the EcoBoost V6 engine work for its name. It still manages only a combined 19 miles per gallon while generating 380 horsepower. It's actually more concerned with blinding headlamps, LED running lights and full LED taillights and the 20-inch rims that replaced its standard 18s. If you'd like to relive the pre-recession 2000s, there's even a reserve model with 22-inch wheels. New features include the 8-inch MyLincoln Touch display with SYNC standard, as well as a push-button starter, passive entry and a rear-view camera to go with leather seating and a bunch of other luxury features we're sure the dealer can talk about at length.<br >  <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/10-suvs-to-get-while-gas-is-cheap'

However, only the Expedition's luxury sibling -- the Lincoln Navigator with its 128 cubic feet of maximum cargo space -- and GM's Chevrolet Suburban/Cadillac Escalade tandem (121 cubic feet) come close to the Expedition's hangar of a frame.<\u002fp>\r\n<p>Just how big is 130.8 cubic feet in SUV terms? It's more nearly double the total cargo capacity KBB's roomiest small SUV, the Nissan Rogue (at 70 cubic feet), and about as much maximum cargo space as the Subaru Forester (74.7) and Nissan Xterra (65.7) combined.
