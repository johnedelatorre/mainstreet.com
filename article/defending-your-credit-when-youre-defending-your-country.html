This is approximately twice the rate of the general population. Predatory lenders and bad circumstances can combine to make <a title="Military Service Members Face Financial Anxiety" href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/military-service-members-face-financial-anxiety">coming home from active military service a nightmare</a>. Still, with a little bit of attention paid up front, you can avoid being a victim or ruining your credit while defending your country.</p>
<p><strong>Read the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</strong></p>
<p>You don't have to actually read the whole act, but you should be familiar with the basic provisions of the <a href="military-members-are-at-a-higher-risk-for-identity-theft--from-family-members.html" target="_blank">Servicemembers Civil Relief Act</a>. "If you have a few small credit issues when you were deployed, you need to look at this law," says Ellie Kay, a family financial expert and wife of an Air Force pilot.</p>
<p>The act provides a number of protections, especially for debts you acquired <em>before</em> you enlisted. Specifically, the law protects you against existing credit card debt, mortgage payments, pending trials, taxes and termination of your lease. "A landlord can't decide to terminate your lease while you're deployed," says Kay. "Your family can't be evicted from housing when you're on active duty for rents less than $1,200 per month."</p>

He points out that as long as you notify the right people <a title="Where Should Military Personnel Retire?" href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/where-should-military-personnel-retire">before you deploy</a>, it's much harder to get into debt trouble.

<p><strong>Subscribe to a Credit Monitoring Service</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, <a href="youre-probably-not-looking-at-your-credit-score-enough-or-correctly.html" target="_blank">credit monitoring servicing are a waste of money</a>. They don't do anything you can't do yourself for free by pulling your credit reports. However, Kay suggests that you subscribe to a credit monitoring service while you're deployed abroad. She has eight presentations on finance coming up in the next four months on six bases with the USAA. "You can have that delivered to your email or your spouse's or whoever has your power of attorney," she says.

<p>Whenever you run into problems, Kay says the first person you should talk to is the <a title=" Who Feels Financially Satisfied? Military Millennials      Hal M. Bundrick     Follow     Aug 15, 2014 10:20 AM EDT  NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Adults in their mid-thirties and below make up about one-third of the U.S. population, 13% of whom say they are unemployed. But there are a significant number of Gen Y workers who are fully employed and financially satisfied, with a high degree of confidence in their job security: military Millennials.  Read More: Young Millennials Value Meaning Over Money  Serving in the armed forces, or the Guard or Reserve, these young adults are doing a lot of the right things financially: putting aside money in an emergency fund and saving for retirement. Though admitting a degree of financial security, they are also struggling with some of the same money misfortunes as their civilian peers.  Read More:Corinthian Colleges Reported to Be Actively Recruiting on Military Bases  Military Millennials are more than twice as likely as their older Armed Forces comrades to have a household income under $50,000. And considering that they have access to free medical care, 16% have past due medical debts – nearly twice as much as older military personnel – perhaps due to ailments suffered prior to their military service.  And Gen Y members of the military, just like many of their civilian counterparts, are frequent users of &quot;alternative banking services,&quot; such as payday lenders, rent-to-own retailers and pawn shops. Near four-in-ten (37%) active duty Millennials admit they've used such high cost non-bank borrowing services within the last five years.  And yet, in spite of these seeming setbacks, they are content in money matters. Fully 39% of active duty Millennials say they have a high level of financial satisfaction. In fact, a survey of 314 military members and 300 civilians conducted on behalf of the Navy Federal Credit Union earlier this year found that 79% of military Millennials were &quot;very&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; satisfied with their current financial situation. That compares to just 61% of their civilian counterparts.  Read More: VA Hospitals Facing Privatization and FBI Criminal Investigation  The same poll revealed 60% of young adults serving their country reported that saving for retirement was &quot;very&quot; important, compared to only 30% of civilians. The FINRA poll verifies that conviction for setting aside money for the future: More than half (53%) of active service Gen Y said they were feeding an emergency fund -- and nearly three quarters are saving for retirement.  --Written by Hal M.

They go under different names in different branches of the service. The Airman and Family Readiness Center is the air force's version, while the army has Army Community Services. "There's usually a legal officer in the chain of command on base," says Sullivan. This officer can provide you with assistance, as well as advice. Sullivan recommends you start out by getting whatever help you can on base before you seek civilian counsel.</p><p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/defending-your-credit-when-youre-defending-your-country' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

<p>"It's also true that most lenders do not like the publicity of looking like they're taking advantage of service people," says Sullivan. "Sometimes just asking can get you out of these circumstances." Sullivan notes that "there's a remarkable support for the American military in this country.</p>
<p>"Even if you get into trouble, the courts are usually pretty friendly in these cases," says Sullivan. "If you accuse a lender of <a title="Obama Drops a Bomb That Would Put Military Benefits Off-Limits to For-Profit Colleges" href="https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obama-drops-a-bomb-that-would-put-military-benefits-off-limits-to-for-profit-colleges">being in violation of federal law</a>, judges tend to be very sympathetic to servicemen."</p>
<p>Kay notes that there's more than just your finances at stake. Your military career could also be on the line. "Financial readiness impacts military readiness," she said. "More and more military members are losing their clearances because of financial issues. It's not just young folks, it's senior enlisted and officers too. They're losing really good people." <br >  <br >  <em>--Written by Nicholas Pell for MainStreet</em></p> <p><div class='OB_TEXT_INACTIVE ob-text' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/defending-your-credit-when-youre-defending-your-country' data-widget-id='AR_4' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script><div class='OB_IMAGES_INACTIVE ob-images' data-src='https://www.mainstreet.com/article/defending-your-credit-when-youre-defending-your-country' data-widget-id='AR_5' data-ob-template='thestreet'></div><script></script></div>

Military Millennials      Hal M. Bundrick     Follow     Aug 15, 2014 10:20 AM EDT  NEW YORK (MainStreet) — Adults in their mid-thirties and below make up about one-third of the U.S. population, 13% of whom say they are unemployed. But there are a significant number of Gen Y workers who are fully employed and financially satisfied, with a high degree of confidence in their job security: military Millennials.  Read More: Young Millennials Value Meaning Over Money  Serving in the armed forces, or the Guard or Reserve, these young adults are doing a lot of the right things financially: putting aside money in an emergency fund and saving for retirement. Though admitting a degree of financial security, they are also struggling with some of the same money misfortunes as their civilian peers.  Read More:Corinthian Colleges Reported to Be Actively Recruiting on Military Bases  Military Millennials are more than twice as likely as their older Armed Forces comrades to have a household income under $50,000. And considering that they have access to free medical care, 16% have past due medical debts – nearly twice as much as older military personnel – perhaps due to ailments suffered prior to their military service.  And Gen Y members of the military, just like many of their civilian counterparts, are frequent users of &quot;alternative banking services,&quot; such as payday lenders, rent-to-own retailers and pawn shops. Near four-in-ten (37%) active duty Millennials admit they've used such high cost non-bank borrowing services within the last five years.  And yet, in spite of these seeming setbacks, they are content in money matters. Fully 39% of active duty Millennials say they have a high level of financial satisfaction. In fact, a survey of 314 military members and 300 civilians conducted on behalf of the Navy Federal Credit Union earlier this year found that 79% of military Millennials were &quot;very&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; satisfied with their current financial situation. That compares to just 61% of their civilian counterparts.  Read More: VA Hospitals Facing Privatization and FBI Criminal Investigation  The same poll revealed 60% of young adults serving their country reported that saving for retirement was &quot;very&quot; important, compared to only 30% of civilians. The FINRA poll verifies that conviction for setting aside money for the future: More than half (53%) of active service Gen Y said they were feeding an emergency fund -- and nearly three quarters are saving for retirement.  --Written by Hal M.

They go under different names in different branches of the service.
